That is the difference between Mediocrity and Greatness. Each is an entirely different world, and alien to the inhabitants of the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mediocrity, Success and Greatness, these are abstract concepts. A common nature of abstract terms is that they are easy to understand, hard to define. We agree which is what, but we cannot explain why things are so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Mediocrity, Success and Greatness all have characteristics that can be understood. When asked to identify the wisdom of the crowd, we are quick to give a verdict on their mediocrity. Yet, when asked to point out a truly mediocre person, we are doomed to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see this as an interesting phenomenon. Mediocrity seems to be a collective attribute, and not an individual one. Commonplace behavior such as pouting when taking selfies, or spending time in social media, or binging on Netflix, engaging in small-talk, are some of the often cited mediocre behaviors. A behavior, therefore, seems to become mediocre when it is widely replicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this have any implication for being successful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depends on how we see success. What is the difference between a person who is truly genius, leaves a vast treasure of knowledge in plain sight, and a person who rises to fame leveraging on mediocre public behavior. Two entirely different domains of talent. Those who leverage mediocre behavior are themselves not mediocre, they simply make use of mass interests. A silent genius on the other hand, is too busy creating value, to focus on leveraging mediocre behavior. Who is more successful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard to say. The person who leverages mediocre behavior, no doubt a talent, is incredibly social, has wide networks and outreach. Yet, when it comes to subject matter, they are far from a genius’ depth of knowledge. And what about the geniuses? Success, it seems, has a price for them as well. The very advantage of living in the extremely deep roots of knowledge, the fringe domains of interest and insightful way of thinking falls short in social interaction. Very few take interest in what they have to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often equate success with greatness. Possibly because success is associated with quantity. But greatness is not just about quantity. It has an intrinsic quality that makes it stand out from success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a rickshaw puller for example, who rises to fame for being a viral singer. The momentary greatness that gave everyone joy, soon becomes commodified, and now their fame may define their sudden success, but it does not guarantee continuation of the spark of greatness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That brings us to the fundamental difference between mediocrity and greatness. Mediocrity demands us to be mediocre for the sake of pleasing mediocre behavior. It limits our potentials to what we could be. Greatness on the other hand is unbound and limitless. Socrates was famously said to have claimed that he knew he was a wise man because he knew that he knew nothing. Greatness is attained when we are open to possibilities. The pursuit of greatness takes us out of our comfort zone, that boundary within mediocre practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the path to greatness has always been solo. Great minds, who surfed the fringes of the sea of knowledge, were often misunderstood, or even isolated. By thumb rule, no human is mediocre, and every human being is at some stage of greatness. We, therefore, now turn to the four stages in the pursuit of greatness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stage is characterised by loneliness. We intuitively realize that there is something unique in us, that others fail to understand or even value. We can choose to be mediocre by abandoning this uniqueness for the sake of immediate success and gratification. Interestingly, when we immerse ourselves in mediocre behavior, we are the happiest and most ignorant. Most of us would desire this state. Yet, when we return home, we realize that something was not understood, and therefore we crave to be understood for those parts. For these reasons, loneliness is perhaps the most universally common state of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some people choose to follow their instincts and pursue the unique things they feel they have. This can be a new skill or a pursuit of areas of a knowledge expertise or even self-mastery. The evident result is that being misunderstood by those who are still in the first stage. Because they are still stuck in the mediocre boundaries, they resent those who have set themselves free from it. The journey therefore begins alone. It takes immense courage to leave mediocrity to pursue something that is unique. But the path to greatness has only been set off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the third stage, those who have begun their journey alone, are soon resented by those who cannot free themselves. In their pursuit, they start to feel that they are slowly becoming isolated from others. They realize they enjoy quality time doing things that have intrinsic value rather than waste time pretending to mimic mediocrity. Isolation grows severe everyday, and the seeker of great things starts to doubt their journey. Once again, they feel they are missing something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the final stage, they realize what they were missing. They were missing themselves. They had been looking for acceptance in others. In that subtle desire, they didn’t realize they were denying their own value. The resentment that they had escaped was still haunting them. That is, a part of them still thought and saw themselves as mediocre. But in the final stage, they no longer needed self affirmation, or appreciation from others. They understand that the path to greatness is better spent on valuing the present, the little gifts and great wisdom in those who came before them. Mediocre people now seem like children compared to them. Just as an adult would no longer feel interest to spend excessive time playing with children, the wise and great would find it more rewarding to spend time in solitude and pursue their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All human beings are born great, but somehow we seem to get stuck in mediocre play. For many, being mediocre is not often a choice. Everyday circumstance forces us to adapt to others, we are, after all, social beings. But the path to greatness is a conscious choice, and a choice always worth making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Death is not your enemy. Neither your friend. Do not expect it. Do
not flirt with it. Do not try running away from it. True Power comes
from acceptance of Death. The courage to live comes to you only when
you accept this truth.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suffering is inevitable. No one deserves unnecessary sufferings. Do
not inflict unnecessary sufferings on any living, feeling being. Do
not inflict unnecessary suffering on yourself. If you see someone
suffering, be ready to suffer to ease theirs. Do not expect anything
in return.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are always wrong about life. But each mistake you make gives
you an opportunity to be less wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help others. Learn how to help others so that you can help others.
Help yourself so that you can help others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take care of your health. Avoid anything that is tempting but leads
only to bad consequences for your health. If someone needs your help
with help, help them with your knowledge if you have it. If not,
call for help.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be ready to suffer for others. Do not expect. Do not force your
help on anyone. Offer your help when they need it most. Be on the
lookout.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not try avoiding sufferings. Do not try getting rid of it. The
more you avoid sufferings, the more you will desire it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Know your duties. There is no end to your duties. Know your
priorities. Know how to learn, so that you can perform your
duties.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not trust anyone. Do not trust anything that involves desire.
Desire weakens. Desire distracts. Do not desire to do good because
it makes you happy. Do good, because you do good. If happiness is
why you want to do good, avoid doing so.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do good. Expect nothing. Ignore gratitude or rebuke. Do not trust
anyone but yourself. Be suspicious of those who plant themselves in
you. Do not let your-self torn to pieces.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be transparent. Know yourself. Know what you want, what you desire
and where you stand. Desire is bad. Keep it caged, even if it causes
sufferings to you. If your desire compels you to commit harm, pay
attention to your health. Take sleep. Go somewhere. Take a
bath.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not aim to achieve. Only do what is before you. Know what to do.
How to do. When to do. Know enough so you know how to do what you
have to do when it’s your time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are desired by others, or you desire others and it causes
chaos, make peace. Avoid desire at all cost. Abandon if necessary
and be on your own.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not tell to do good. Do not force to do good. Show how to good
is done. Keep yourself pure. Keep yourself ready. Keep yourself
sharp.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the bad approaches you, for definitely it will, know why, how
and what causes it. Do not run. Do not hide. Understand why bad is
bad. Prevent it before the bad is born. Fight bad if it is near.
Compensate if the harm is already done. Follow your heart. The heart
knows well what is good and what is bad. If not, you do not possess
one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not follow. Do not be blind. See. Move. Observe. Evaluate.
Think. Act. Think again. Do what is good and strive to do
better.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not speak unless you are prompted to. Greet with smiles and wish
everyone good. Speak what you are asked to answer and not anything
else. Speak the truth, even if it causes sufferings. Speak truth at
all cost. Listen and ask for help when you need it. But do not
expect to be helped.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not make friends. Be just to everyone. Do not believe
everything. Believe that people suffer and they need help. Offer
your help but do not force it. If declined, stay away but do not
leave. Keep an eye out, for some are unable to ask for help when
they need it the most.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never be violent. Never cause chaos. Keep calm. Keep your emotions
to yourself. If someone offers you help, accept it and show
gratitude.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Know what is important. Sleep if you must. Eat if you must. Let
others have their share if they are in need of it too. Feel others
so you know what to do. But do not let yourself become one of them.
Feel sad about the world. Feel angry at the injustice. Hate
ignorance. But do not treat people in hurtful ways. Be courteous. Be
kind. And do not make unnecessary overuse of it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The knowledge that corrupts is rogue knowledge. The knowledge that
misguides you is not knowledge. The knowledge that tells you to
exploit others is bad knowledge. Know them well. Do not let yourself
act upon them before you know both sides of the coin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

### **Why Stories Matter** {#4e67 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--figure .graf--title name="4e67"}

[E]{.graf-dropCap}ach of us are parts of a great epic. And it all began
with our ability to question the things that we see, hear, feel or
experience in other forms. Who I am in this infinite universe full of
elements that I can barely keep count of? Where is my place in this
vastness of reality, in this complex mathematical chaos of space and
time? Where am I going with these small endeavors of mine? What am I
building with these hopeless aspirations? Why do I keep going, despite
all the hurdles and pain, what is it that keeps me going?

But do all stories belong to us?

Think of it. As kids, we were told stories, we believed in them, we
followed them. Some worked for us, some didn't. So we kept revising
these stories as each attempt led to a different version in different
instances. We grew up to believe in these stories, stories that had
inspired us, motivated us through the evocation of hope, fear and
desire. When in the face of arduous challenges, we recall these stories
and act, as if the protagonists of the very stories we had put faith in.

We ourselves are stories as well. Living, moving lumps of flesh brought
to sporadic spontaneity by predefined stories that tell us to walk in a
certain way, talk in a certain way, love in a certain way. We may as
well be living our entire life following the scripted fictions that were
written even before we were born. Before we decided, we are already the
characters of an elaborate epic woven by the narrators from the past.

Seeing ourselves living in a physical world brought about by epic
stories make us question the authenticity of things. If nothing is
authentic, where do we find authenticity? Maybe the authentic elements
are in our tiny additions to each story that we live. A small idea alone
cannot survive, unless it joins a cult of ideas. Thus, in order to
survive, we keep enriching the trove of ideas, the cults that have been
leading the narratives since the ancient times.

Fiction is a form of storytelling which gives us many superhuman
abilities. Simply by being able to connect abstract ideas, we can make
them feel real. In fiction, you can turn time, you can revive the dead,
you can have vengeance over your unbeatable nemesis. Stories, give you
the power to write the reality as you will, and if others believe in
them, then there is no other being more powerful than you, because the
reality we live is itself based on stories.

That is how all great epics have come into being. It all began with
simple emotion that attracted the readers, a little bit of persuasion to
believe in the reality of the story, until the story starts demanding
the reader to follow the will of the narrator down the path of the plot
and character relations. And this is exactly why we must tell good
stories, stories that are inclusive and kind, where characters are
conflicted but strives to establish inherently benevolent ideals.
Because strange enough, by the time a story takes its roots, the
narrator doesn't remain important, what remains important is the story,
the very gist of an imagined reality which has no existence in itself
yet exists through those who believe in it, and act as it commands.

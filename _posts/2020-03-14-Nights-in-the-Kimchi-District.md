The woman was in her fifties. With a few wrinkles around her ordinary
face, she was barely old enough to be called an elderly citizen. She
wore a kimono, white flowers on the red print. But she didn't wear any
makeup, no, I think. Her hair was far from geisha black. It has caught
the ashes by now.

"I fell in love with Kimchi District."

"Kimchi District? The place is a garbage zone."

"And I live here. I was born and raised in this Garbage, believe me."

"It's hard to believe, but if you say so.." She shrugs.

"Kimchi was never nice to me. The people there were rude, and I guess I
always got bullied at school because I couldn't fit it. I realized much
later that it was because people in Kimchi were underprivileged and it
wasn't their fault that they were poor and always fighting against each
other."

"Interesting. When did you learn that?"

"I went to London to study Humanities. We had a few small arid areas in
the neighbourhood. When my father fell ill, I had to sell those lands
for his medical care. That didn't save him though. It was me and my
father only from the beginning. When father passed away, I was alone in
our hut, and it was really scary."

"And you made it to London all by yourself?"

"I won a scholarship. I took the money and all that I had with me to
there. I was sure, I was never going to return. So there was no point in
keeping anything. I sold our hut as well. Like I said, I was not
planning to return."

"Did you like it there? In London?"

"Absolutely, it was the kind of place, where posh people moved in their
posh cars and posh shoes. I had some trouble blending in, but they were
some nice people. I met Laura there, at the University. We dated for a
few months. On those days, we worked together in the library, and shared
a flat. On most nights, we would sneak out and roam the streets of
London. It was risky though. But we enjoyed it."

"You remind me of my own days. My husband and I had a kid. Sean. His
name was Sean. He was beautiful. I loved the way he bore himself on his
tiny little feet and balanced his little body on them. In Alberta, it
was mostly rainy, so we often stayed indoors. He was fond of the
hourglass that my husband had. It was his favourite toy."

"You sound like you were very happy with your family."

"We were. John lost his job suddenly. He wasn't ready for it. No one
was. On most days, he'd come home drunk and crying."

"I'm sorry to hear that. It must have been difficult. I hope they are
alright now."

"Yes, yes, John is here with Sean. They are into playing cards these
days. But tell me about Laura. What was she like?"

"Laura? Uh.. well she was the crazy one, really. We parted when we
graduated, she said she wanted to be independent, and that our
relationship would only be a hindrance. I really hated her for that,
back then. But really, she was the only woman I had ever fallen in love
with.

After, parting with Laura, I was looking for jobs as well. Laura used to
pay for our flat. When she left, I realized that I had spent most of my
account in keeping up with our relationship. It was pretty frustrating."

"But how did you return to Kimchi?"

"I had been homeless for a while. I got caught up with some bad
business. The home office wasn't pleased."

"So they sent you home?"

"They sent me back to Kimchi. When I arrived in Kimchi, I was horrified,
by the way people spoke and moved here."

"I see what you mean, I do not like it too."

"In fact, I was horrified by everything here, the food, the culture, the
air and the streets. I had no one here and I was a misfit here as well.
I had no jobs and I saw no chances of surviving."

"And yet you are fine now."

"I am. Thanks to my pimp."

We both fall silent for a while. She gets up and starts to take off her
Kimono.

"What about the nights on Kimchi District that you were telling me?"

"When I got back to our sold hut..." I pause to look at her body, it was
full of wrinkles as well... "I was broken."

"Sitting on the porch, I smoked my last cigarette, and I poured a whole
bottle of whiskey on my breath. I crawled there, under the open sky, and
I suddenly became aware that the stars were gazing down at me. I cried a
little, calling Laura's name, and remembering my father, and the streets
of London, the nights we snuck out of our little flat. The stars had
been watching me then, too. May be they'd do something about me now."

"And then the most amazing thing in my life happened. Someone brushed my
hairs gently. I closed my eyes, and I knew it was Laura, she had come to
take me away from this pain. I shut my eyes tight, I was afraid, what if
she went away if I saw her?"

"You were hallucinating, I presume?"

"Worse, it was a stray dog's tail. The poor thing had sneaked up
unnoticed on the porch. It was as I said, Laura had been real, but only
as long as my eyes were closed. When I opened it, I was back in the
night of Kimchi District."

"That was a nice story. But you know, I have to get going" She says, now
getting dressed now in her fancy jeans and tops.

Back at the station, I tell her goodbye, and she promises me that she'll
send me post cards with the nightscape of Alberta on them.

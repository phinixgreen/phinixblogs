He was starving. She was craving for a cup of coffee.

They met in a shimmying alley of the Elephant Road. He wore glasses and
worn out jeans. She wore salwar and heels. They never knew each other.
It was just another lazy winter afternoon, the sun hid behind towering
heights of buildings huddled by one another, like young school-friends
growing old together. In the stream of crowd, old cars and rolling dusty
rickshaws, she was lost, and he found her a cafe that she didn't know.
Thank you so much, she could have said, and he could have asked her if
she could help him have something to fill his churning stomach for the
afternoon. She could have asked him why, and he might not have replied
that he forgot his wallet, and that he knew it was odd to ask a stranger
for such a favor. She could frown and say nobody did it anymore, that
the streets aren't safe like before, and no one should trust a stranger,
and he could have replied that isn't that what society is supposed to
look like, humans helping humans, and she could have asked him, isn't it
strange that out of nowhere she is the one whom he had asked for it, and
he might have laughed out loud and said the same could apply to her.
They could end up being the last customers of the coffeeshop, she would
tell him all about her terrible past, how she had fled the orphanage,
and he would listen to her, keenly, looking deep into her eyes, feeling
every word of it, and he would respond with gentle nods, and she would
laugh, shrug it off and say life's like that. The bystanders would carry
on, completely indifferent to the bond that could have happened between
two complete strangers, and a band of stray dogs would make a tussle,
one wagging tail annoyingly over the face of the rest, the barking would
not interrupt the conversation, it would, by then, have shifted to how
the scars had made their home in the boy's face, and he would detail the
scenes after the accident that had killed his father and left his mother
imprisoned to wheelchair for life. While he would recount the story, the
girl would touch his hand, and the waiter would put down the fifth pair
of coffee-cups, clearly annoyed. The flies would roam the stale, greasy
ketchup bottle, and the white tables could gleam in the afternoon ray,
if the glass door swiveled tirelessly. She could have felt like she
could go on and on with him, and might even imagine him in her husband's
place, who would not force himself on her, every night, making love
without any love, and he could have pictured someone to look after his
mother once he was gone, for he was tired of looking for job and refused
heartlessly. And in that moment, years could have passed between two
complete strangers, the beaches of Bali, the treks in Nepal, a small
house in a small suburb, with little wraps of happinesses each day,
affordable and effortless. But of course strangers do not talk to each
other anymore, and neither did they, he showed her a cafe with his
rickety index finger. She went on her way, and a parallel universe where
two strangers could have been together, remained horribly blank.

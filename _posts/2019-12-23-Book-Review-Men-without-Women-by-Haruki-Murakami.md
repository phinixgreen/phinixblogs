### Book Review --- "*Men without Women"* by Haruki Murakami {#e641 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--figure .graf--title name="e641"}

Seven stories of love, loss, memories and haunting; Haruki Murakami's
short stories provide yet another glimpse into his character crafting
genius.

#### Drive my car {#48d0 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="48d0"}

Drive my car is about a driver and the car owner discussing their past,
their sorrows. It is a story of loss, and every character in this story
have lost something, in one way or another. Drive my car is a good
opener, I think.

#### Yesterday {#200b .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="200b"}

I liked Yesterday the most. Possibly because of the character Kitaru,
who learns Kansai and has a strange relationship with his girlfriend
Erika. The experimentation of relationship may strike repulsive to some,
but from the characters point of view, the presentation gives it a very
romantic aura.

#### An Independent Organ {#2337 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="2337"}

An Independent Organ is a fall story, where a guy Tokai, falls in love
and consequently into the deathbed made by himself. Tokai is a repulsive
character, even so, his fall makes us sorry, one that is associated with
pity and not empathy.

#### Scheherazade {#82ff .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="82ff"}

Scheherazade perhaps is the most interesting story in this book.
Mysterious in its context, the story of Scheherazade is rather creepy
yet lovable in its portrayal of not having the love we think we deserve.
There is a surreal touch, which I liked a lot in this story.

#### Kino {#6bf9 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="6bf9"}

Kino is a story about cheating. Not only it is a story about loss, and
heartbreak, but also of spiritual corruption. It is another fall story
where the character slowly slips down the Faustian slope. Even so, the
readers can feel the rage and the self pity, the guilt driving the
downfall of Kino.

#### Samsa in Love {#96a3 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="96a3"}

Samsa in Love is a reproduction of Franz Kafka's Metamorphosis. I loved
the inter-textual references here, and how he puts the contexts in
similar grounds. I think I loved the context reproduction rather than
the characters in the story.

#### Men Without Women {#cb7e .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="cb7e"}

Men without Women somehow seemed a closing remark to all these stories.
A person falls in love, gets separated, and therefore forever misses and
cherishes the memories of love. I liked how the stream of consciousness
is presented, which is a nonlinear narrative of the character's
backstory.

#### Overall Remarks {#e2c0 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="e2c0"}

**Rating : 4/5**

Some have remarked that Haruki Murakami is probably good at crafting
novels rather than short-stories, which sometimes might seem right.
However, a close look at the author's writing style says that he has
been able to bend the rules of crafting to his advantage. Sometimes this
may result in odd-standing stories which are more or less good to read.

Murakami has been sober in his portrayal and writing, even so the
protagonists do reflect the male perspective. As for cheating, sex,
relationship, spirituality & loss, I wonder how characters written from
a female perspective might look like.

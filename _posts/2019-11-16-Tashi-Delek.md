### Tashi Delek {#8e04 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--figure .graf--title name="8e04"}

There was snow on the mountains, and the trees were green and humble.\
Tashi Delek, said the sky, and the eyes of the keen larks.

Stepping down on the tarmac, the chill wind, the airport down the valley
stretching neat on soundless Paro,\
drive through the rising heights, green trees smudging in ash grey of
the shadow.

Liquid ice-water ran, over the rocks, and stones,\
wash the little pebbles into the sonder dance of a familiar-unknown.

Remember the breeze of dear homeland, the dark fog, the fumes that make
the lungs ache in horror?\
You came back to inhale carbon, closer to death's door.

You walk into a hotel, warm, and posh, with dressy staff and picture of
the King. The Queen beside.

"Chew the food well, and eat to your hearts content, strangers." they
said.\
You were a traveler and you were hungry, and so you were their guest.

The rices mixed with cabbages and kewa datsi ends well with butter-milk
feast.

Darkness melts down, a sun greeting, with warmth.\
Jump into the taxi and ride along the driver.

The Big Buddha sits at his calm\
throne of the hill, the steps golden\
and clean.

Loving pups wag their small woolen tails with wonder,\
at the white men who open their jaw and click their photo,\
A lass smiles without uttering dzongkha.

There you stand, at the ancient of an epic.\
The lucky charm bringer, the wooden masks and the little stone figures.\
Remember who you were? Before finding yourself in the land of Dzongs?\
Up the road to Dochala temple at the hill, the paddy fields sitting by
the boulders?

The road riding mothers look, through you, their babies saddled in the
back with woolen warmth,\
who knew strangers with flashy hats and capes, seeking peace in land of
Druks.\
See the monks, who say less, and climb more the monasteries?\
The steps sneaking up the flesh of the mountains, the roads bending like
a reel?\
Here is a sky that runs along, the moon watching, the sleeping faces in
the back of the taxi cars.

Before all that greed and lust, there was an earth first.\
To whom we return after many unresolved thirsts.\
But there is peace, when you rise, when you climb the dirt-road to
Taktsang,\
The tiger that sits like a stone.

Some descents would come in illuminating lightness.\
You were tired but breathing slow.

Close these eyes, dream of what the heart desires,\
the terrors and the lithe growing fears.\
But then you meet strangers in that land\
The eyes speaking more languages, grand.

And you wonder, why some wisdom lies far from home,\
and when you're lost in crooked pander.

To you, then a raven comes down and speaks in clear-\
"Feast thy eyes, for these are the smallest days,\
the green would be gone and the air would be waste.\
Feast your soul, keep it content,\
for death will hang over you,\
Do not let it make you afraid."

But perhaps there is wisdom in suffering, there is wisdom in doing small
things.\
Perhaps there are things to be learnt from words said and not said.

Tashi Delek, said the wake up call.\
The wings took off, and the Dzongs sped behind.

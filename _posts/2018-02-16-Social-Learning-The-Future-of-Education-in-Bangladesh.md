*As a student, what is that one thing you hated most?*

I think most would agree, that the worst part of being a student is that
you have to study.

No kidding.

Honestly, I don't blame you and no one should. Ask anyone, and they will
say, "it's the system!" And of course if you follow the pages, you might
agree that the system is a big mess right now.

But there's this one assumption I'd like to challenge. That the
education system in Bangladesh will never reach the credence of
excellence.

I used to be a pessimist, until I realized that despite the
difficulties, Bangladesh is still a field full of extreme potentials for
new ideas to take hold. Because why not?

> If you see a wall, it doesn't mean you shouldn't proceed. It means
> there's a door somewhere around.

Most of us tend to miss that perspective and fail to put emphasis on
these new ideas.

The existing educational system faces great peril of extinction because
it lacks new ideas. It is not because the administration is a failure,
no, but rather, the way the amount and complexity of information and
knowledge bases are escalating that it is rather hard to keep up with
the present strategies adopted.

So, what goes on in the traditional scenario?

Wake up, hit for school, get back, go to coaching, get back, do
homework, get to sleep, and repeat?

> But where is the fun in that?

You skip classes, you hang out with friends, bingeing sitcoms and games,
and on the eve of exam, you look for suggestions, may be cheat a little
(or a lot!) and pass and the rest of the script may rest in peace
forever somewhere, which is definitely not in your brain.

It seems, education and fun are two totally different things. Hmm. Why
is that?

> What if I told you, that both can happen together?

You don't like school because you don't like your teacher, your teacher
hates teaching because he has to check your exam scripts day and night.

Frankly speaking, I believe, we have come to a point where things could
turn different ways. Education has so far been in the clutches of
unsocial nerds. But since everyone's on social networks, why not all
these social spaces open avenues for social educations systems?

I can see some of you are already squirming to say that we already have
that. Yes. We do. There are lots of MOOCs offered in online education
platforms. Why not build our own, catered to our own social environment?

[**The self-paced, self-guided and self-funded education system could be
the education of future

You don't need to sit for long three-hour exams to prove that you have
memorized everything in the book. Instead you take small modules, which
continuously allows a software system which lets you assess your
progress and helps you where you need the balm. Your content is easily
accessible in a digital library, and it is also made easy for you to
access anything related on the internet. You don't follow a curriculum
that you don't like, you study whatever interests you, and whatever you
feel like studying at any time!

How will you be evaluated? Instead of a central evaluation system, once
machines test your depth of subject knowledge, you apply for subjective
problems, and that, like social media, is peer reviewed with likes and
may be awarded through honorary publications (edited by a team of expert
consultants).

Not only that! You do not need to pay for schools and admissions. You
earn your skills, and you get paid for it! It's like a personal micro
scholarship where you study, you test yourself and you award yourself
for the hard work!

When you are applying for job, they don't see your grades in the CV.
Instead, they assess your area of expertise, which you have earned
through your modules, and hire you.

You might be thinking, where could be the fun in that?

Well, once you are not bound go to school, you are free to go anywhere.
The online forums have proved that you can discuss and bounce ideas with
anyone around the world. So why not, explore the libraries, storm the
cafes and online spaces and take charge of your learning?

And the teachers, please do not be afraid, you are not losing your jobs
if the education system is automated, you will have lots of people to
come to you for guidance, for creative initiatives such a study fairs
and contributing to researches. And I think by charging a minimal amount
you still could sustain yourself very well.

So, how to achieve this?

I propose introducing an ICT based Educational Framework which makes use
of all these features I have suggested. This is a personal project,
still in the phase of formulation. But anyone is welcome to come forward
and join the march. Because an idea is more important than anything and
this, I think, is an idea worth spreading.

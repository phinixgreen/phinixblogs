Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a growing field of study in
Neuroscience. It also intersects with many Neuroethical issues. An
emerging Nueroethical dilemma arising with the application of BCIs is
its dual uses. I recently came across a paper by Ienca et al. (2018).
This post will attempt to provide a brief synopsis and commentary on the
topic of the paper.

**What is the Dual-Use Neurotech?**

According to Ienca et al. (2018) the dual-use problem refers to the use
of bio-tech for both civilian and military purposes as well as the
beneficial applications and harmful misuses.

Since Neurotech is a sub-branch of Biotech, this definition of dual-use
also applies to Neurotechnology such as BCIs.

According to Leuthardt et al. (2004, p.6) a BCI converts brain signals
of the user into outputs which communicates the user's intents without
using muscles or peripheral nerves.

Ienca et al. (2018, p. 269) maintains that non-invasive consumer grade
BCIs are presently available with the use cases of device-control,
self-neuromonitoring and personalized entertainment. Same technology is
used in warfighting equipment modulation for better usage.

An example of BCI being used in military funded projects is the DARPA's
BRAIN Initiative. Clinicians on the other hand have been using BCI to
treat neurological disorders.

It is, as Ienca et al. (2018, p. 270) puts, an ethical dilemma because
it manifests itself as a conflict between two ethical duties- the
prevention of bad such as military arsenalisation and the promotion of
good such as clinical applications.

**The Argument**

The academics argue that Dual-Use Neurotechnology can run in
circularity. That is clinical and consumer-grade application of
neurotech can also seep into military application and vice-versa.

Some scholars have called for a Global ban on Dual-use Neurotechnology.
However, it has to be kept in mind that many of the clinically
beneficial to civilian projects are also military funded.

**Why this is Important**

The authors have urged the need for increased monitoring of the dual-use
of neurotechnology. The authors also argue that Neurodevices have the
capacity to alter neural correlates of mental processes. Since, Dual-use
Neurotech are not properly identified in the Human Rights to Autonomy,
Privacy and Mental or Physical Integrity, their harmful uses could go on
unrecognized.

**The Recommendations**

The authors recommend that these uses of dual-use neurotech should be
identified in relation to Human Rights to Autonomy, Privacy, Mental or
Physical Integrity. They also urge that developing codes of ethical
conduct will maximise benefits of military neuroscience and the harms of
civilian use cases. In particular -

1. Clinical Trials should be preceded by safety and effectiveness

2. Treatment resistant conditions should be prioritised

3. Unintended collateral damage to brain functions should be reduced

4. IRB approval and informed consent should be followed

**Some Thoughts**

The authors mention that neuroscientists sometimes may not consider how
their work contributes to warfare. I think this is a very important
point and therefore agree with the authors that establishing a
neurosecurity framework could raise awareness among neuroscientists.

Perhaps it can be added as a comment that to monitor dual-use neurotech,
it should be regulated more strictly. For example, DIY BCI could lead to
dual use dilemas of terrorist/rogue state research, however low the
probability might be. On the other hand, it may be riskier to assume
that only military funded projects are destructive. Cases of Corporate
Enterprises such as Facebook has shown that the data of the masses are
not always safe in the hands of corporate entities. Consumer-grade
Neurotech are therefore probably better off being regulated. If the
Neurotech are restricted to Clinical Research only, it might be easier
to monitor and regulate its dual uses.

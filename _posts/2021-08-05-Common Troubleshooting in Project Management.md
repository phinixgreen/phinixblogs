One of our community members, when asked about their experience of managing projects, shared that, their "experience is like making [their] way through a sludge of obstacles however [they] can"

We hear you! Ask any project manager, you will hear a more or less similar kind of description of their experience. Management, however, sophisticated the word sounds, is often a mess of plans, processes and actions in reality. The good news is, you are not alone in this, and people have come up with effective strategies to make remedies to certain commonly faced problems. These strategies may not ensure complete removal of the problem, but it can mitigate them.

Here are some of your commonly faced problems, and how others have come up with strategies to greatly mitigate these problems.

## We find it "challenging to follow the plan"

Benjamin Franklin is often quoted to have said that -
> “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.”

He is not wrong. Even though the plan alone is not everything, it is, still, a key frame of reference for everyone so that everyone is on the same page. In other words, a plan is just a communication tool.

So why does it feel like we are having challenges in following the plan?

The answer is not to be found in our action, but in the planning document. Is our project plan detailed enough? Is our project plan flexible enough to accommodate everyone's needs and capacities? How do we manage changes to our project plan, when we see there is something inconsistent?

These are the questions you might need to prepare for when you start planning the project.

## We try to "make [the] group follow the plan"

Oftentimes we are not really in-charge of the project, and the team is already selected for us. This is common for students in higher education. A common psychology that works for some is that "I can relax while others do my work". For more serious students in the team, this is a problem. We try to **make our group follow the plan**.

This is by far the most common and most difficult question to answer, because humans are the most dynamic beings, and not just bits and blobs that follow instructions. They are intelligent agents with emotions and unique circumstances of their own.

Experts have now found that it is easier if the whole team is in charge of the plan instead of a single person.

It might sound messy, but bear with us. Team Consensus is a major risk in any project. If the team does not come to a consensus, but still have to deliver a project, some may relapse and leave others to do their work.

The idea behind team consensus goes a long way back to emotional and cognitive empathy. Cognitive empathy comes in handy when you are trying to exchange ideas. Emotional empathy comes handy when you are handling conflicts. Both are useful to have for all members of the team, and not just team leaders. [^1]

The key to reaching consensus is not taking charge, but distributing the charge among the team.

How can we distribute the ownership of a single endeavour among the whole team? Will it not get chaotic?

## "in this pandemic, it is hard to even communicate"

Ofcourse, in this pandemic, we are dealing with unprecedented chaos. But this is where it gets interesting. Experts suggest certain techniques that align task, communication and team-coordination, even during chaotic times.

Instead of communicating continuously, or on a just-in-time basis, experts suggest giving time to the team to digest the tasks requirements and come back when everyone is ready to meet. Again this is about consensus, and let the team decide. There should not be any negotiation based adjustments. Harvard MIT Experts have suggested that negotiation compromises the internal emotional frame of reference that the team members have. [^2]

You can try the following techniques to communicate and plan better.

Break the Project into Large Work-Items. The Large Work-Items can be broken down to Medium-Work-Items. The Medium Work Items can be broken down to Small Work Items. Repeat this process until you have work-items for which individuals are solely responsible for a single task.

Now let the team decide which work item they want to work on. Remember, this is done during a meeting, and these meetings are usually long. Make sure everyone is available for these meetings.

Now let the owners of the tasks estimate how much time they are going to take to finish the task they own. Do not expect them to be correct about their estimation. Human beings are terrible at estimating. Also, experts suggest not to force anyone to adjust their estimate. Different people have different circumstances, and only the owners should estimate the tasks they own.

## Our "plans are constantly updated"

This cannot be avoided. In fact this is a good sign that the project is agile. Oftentimes you might see that estimations are wrong. What was committed for five days, took twenty days.

This is why it is wise to not tackle all work items in one blow.
That is, you all do your work in private, and then before the final day, you integrate everything, and present the next day. This holds huge risks for certain projects.

For this reason, it is better to have sprints, where the team takes in work items that are most important to work on. Finish within a week or two. Even if some work items are not finished between the estimated time, the team still meets, reviews on what went well according to estimation, and what did not go well during estimation. This is also the time the team re-estimates and plans a new sprint.

Sometimes, documents that are rigid cannot accommodate a dynamically changing plan. This is why professionals use Project Management Apps. **Trello**, **Jira** and **Azure DevOps** are some of the popular coding project management tools that are free to avail for small groups.

You can use these softwares to constantly update your plans. You might benefit from reading up on **Scrum** and **Kanban** which can be implemented using these softwares.

## We feel that we are having "miscommunication that reduces efficiency"

Yet still, there will be miscommunication, because it is a human factor, and for this reason, experts suggest, having short daily meetings.

Provide everyone a template like this and request everyone to follow it for the sake of everyone's convenience.

- What am I doing today (1 Minute)
- What blocks am I facing currently (1 Minute)

Do not try to solve these blocks immediately, unless they are solvable immediately. Take notes, and list the blocks. Prioritize these blocks and let the team think on how they can assist each other on solving these blocks. A **Team Wiki* can help everyone track and document the blocks and find solutions.

## We feel like there is "no point in planning at all"

Lastly, it might often feel like giving up, but the beauty of a project is in the resilience of its team members and the ability to deliver the product (or service) on time.

Oftentimes, you will be re-estimating small work items, there will be conflicts, and delays, but as a team lead, your job is not to do the work, but enable the team to do their work. Following the plan is not the ideal scenario. If this happens, there is something abnormal with the plan or the scenario. The key is adjusting the plan continuously, so that you get better at planning next time.

So keep a balance between documentation and action. Track the project progress, take help of softwares if you need to. Most of all, learn from past sprints, attempts and wrong estimations, so that you can do it better in the next attempt or sprint.

Hopefully, deploying some of these techniques will help you mitigate project risks, and make things a bit smooth for everyone.

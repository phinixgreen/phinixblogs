[On]{.graf-dropCap} an early morning walk to the university square, I
realized that I had forgotten to bring my coat with me. The morning
forecast said it would be terribly windy today.

I was making my way through the Selly, fighting to keep the eyes open
amidst the wind blowing all over my face.

This is not going to work- I thought and took shelter in a nearby bus
stand. I had thought I was the only one out today and was about to curse
out loud when I noticed an elderly man sitting in the corner opposite to
mine.

"Doing alright sir?" He smiled at me and nodded.

I smile back.

I had a feeling that it was going to take long for the wind to stop. It
had been days, since I came here --- away from home, from parents,
without any friends and suddenly all I could think was the damp smell of
my room.

"Missing home?"

"Uh --- yeah. Kind of."

"Why don't you have a sit here? It's cold all over."

"Waiting for the bus?"

"Yeah."

"Where to?"

"Home" He smiled again, his skin crinkled all around his thin eyes. We
sat there, like two odd crows, caught up in the storm. There were people
barely out in the bloody weather.

"You're not from around here, I suppose?"

"Nope."

"Been traveling?"

"A lot."

"That's great! Where have you been so far?" I asked trying to feign
interest. I had absolutely no interest. All I had been thinking about
was how to get to the university square.

"It was a windy day like this. The day it happened. I realized that I
had forgotten to bring my coat with me, my wife said it'd be windy that
day, but we had a fight the previous night, and I was mad at her. I had
nothing in the morning and was headed straight for the university
square."

"Half-way through, the wind worsened and I had no other option to take
refuge in this bus-stand. There- I met my future self. Old. But
standing."

"That's a nice story, sir. Are you sure you're not drunk?"

"If you could meet your future self, what would you have asked him?"

"I'd probably ask if it was worth it. The sufferings. Going through it
all. Was it worth going on."

"You're probably thinking that when you get here, you'd know something
about it. Something about life. But there's nothing to know about it.
Even if you knew all about it, it wouldn't make sense. There's nothing
like it."

"Are you still afraid?"

"More like still afraid but more tired."

"But you didn't answer me really. Was it worth all the sufferings?"

"Remember when your mother used to cook for you?"

"Yeah. What about it?"

"Did you ever wonder if she thought about it too?"

"I miss her."

"Yeah me too." Said the old me, looking away for a while.

"So you already know what's going to happen to me today, don't you?"

"Don't worry. Even if you do bad in the presentation, there's always a
chance you can do better." He smiled again.

"I still think about it every day. Doing it, you know."

"Well, you can see that you certainly did not do it."

"But still."

"Yeah."

"Am I going to lose her?"

"You're going to lose everyone."

"To gain what?"

"Nothing."

"Was I ever supposed have anything?"

"Yes. You had. Your journey is not about gaining. It is about losing
everything and still standing where you are."

"Do you have any advice for me?"

"Go back and get that coat maybe?"

"Anything else?"

"Don't worry much about the presentation. It doesn't matter if you fail.
You'll suffer anyway."

"You sound a lot braver."

"I've already passed through the storms once."

"So have you finally become a philosopher?"

"Now that you've called me one, maybe I have."

"Are you a better person now?"

"I don't know. Are you?"

We sat there. Me and me. The tired me and a more tired future me. Both
waiting for the storm to pass, so that we could go on our own ways. One
young, terribly lost. The other had found the path but at the cost of
everything.

"Are you happy now?"

"Are you?"

"Was I ever?"

"Who was ever?"

"Don't we deserve to be happy?"

"We think we do. But maybe it doesn't exist. Happiness, I mean. Maybe,
we're just looking for the wrong thing."

"Maybe we are, after all."

I thought of all kinds of things. All the faces. The fond corners, the
sepiatic picture albums lying somewhere in the cupboard. The old house
of my grandfather, lying in ruins. I think of the days when my petty
sufferings seemed larger than life. All the grudge, all the rage, and
grit to have vengeance on the people who would hardly remain in my life.

"How does it feel? Sitting there looking back at your younger self?"

"I think of only one thing. Had it been worth it? The journey I mean."

"Do you regret anything?"

"Existing may be. As always. But saying that now would be immature at
this point and biased towards your imagination."

"Are you still immature?"

"It's hard imagining a kid dressed in the skins of an aged. But you have
always been a kid. It's just that, being a kid is not necessarily a bad
thing. The apple of Eden was not worth having at all. Hahaha."

I joined him in the laughter.

At some point, the wind stopped. We realized that it was time to depart
from each other. So that we could continue on our own paths. We shook
hands because it would be awkward hugging yourself.

"It's hard you know." He said. "It will be hard. A lot harder than the
word sounds. But maybe keep at it. In the end, it won't matter. But at
least you'll have something to tell your younger self."

I nodded. "I hope you find your home soon."

"I hope I do." He smiled.

In this post, I try to introduce my readers to the concept of a Tool Stack, and the benefits and challenges associated with using a Tool Stack for Knowledge Management. I have also tried to suggest that consciously planning a tool stack can help you, avoiding some of the common issues in managing Tool Stack including usability, affordability, integration and sustainability. 

# What is a Tool Stack?

Simply put a Tool Stack is a modern way of saying that **you have a collection of tools that you use together to complete a certain project or work**. A Tool Stack is like a Digital Tool Box, where each tool is either a Desktop Software, Web App or even Physical Objects. You usually have a certain workflow for these stacks, where information flows from one tool of the stack to another, depending on which phase of processing the information is.

For example: My note-taking Tool Stack includes Apple Notes (+iPencil), Physical Notebook (+Pen), Sublime Text, VS Code, Git and GitHub. I use these different tools for three different but overlapping functions- Note-taking, Note-Making and Note-Security. At each stage, the information that I collect flows from left to right of these tools, and when the information reaches the rightmost tool, I can say, a typical process has been accomplished.

# What is Knowledge Management?

In brief words, Knowledge Management is the system, the mechanism, the mindset and the processes used for managing your personal knowledge, and the knowledge of your team or organization. Knowledge Management is how you collect knowledge artefacts (data, information, knowledge or wisdom held in unitary items such as book, journal articles, news articles, encyclopedia etc.), absorb these artefacts to produce distilled or extended versions of artefacts that help you, your team, your organization or your client in accomplishing something (a project or task) in a better, smarter way.

I like the *Seek, Sense, Share* Knowledge Management Framework by Harold Jarche, because it is compact, simple and easy to remember. According to Jarche (2014) himself, the *Seek, Sense, Share* Framework is a "framework for individuals to take control of their professional development through a continuous process of seeking, sensing-making, and sharing" knowledge which" has potential to help each of us, the netizens, to make sense of our digital world and thereby work together more effectively.

If I got it correctly, Jarche's framework helps us seek valid, and valuable sources of knowledge, absorb, understand and process the information that we get from these sources and make the world a better place by sharing the knowledge that we distilled or added to the existing body of work.

# The Challenges of using a Tool Stack

A fun fact about Knowledge Management and Tool Stack is that they go hand in hand.

Symbolically, Knowledge Management is more like our mind and the Tool Stack is more like the brain. The brain hosts the information, and although no one can see the information interacting with one another in our mind, the different responses produced by the modules of the brain, the actions and feedback is what others can see. In other words, most of the knowledge management process is something that you hold in your mind, it is mostly mental models and processes. The rest of the work of knowledge processing is done with the help of peripheral physical, hardware and software tools, which we call together a Tool Stack.

One difficulty that can arise commonly, is that we easily get enamoured with an interface and start right away with a tool with no well defined purposes. However, as time grows, chaos starts to ensue because of the lack of preplanning. Another difficulty that can arise with the Tool Stack, is the *Paralysis by Analysis*- that is given too much of choice and information, we become confused as to what to choose for getting the work done. 

# Consciously preparing for a tool stack for knowledge management

Consciously preparing for a Tool Stack for Knowledge Management, might not guarantee that the system will provide maximum productivity, but it can at least prepare you for some unforeseen circumstances.

Here are two things to keep in mind when picking, choosing and architecting your Tool Stack for Knowledge Management.

# Things to keep in mind

## Functions of the framework

Functions of the Framework that you are implementing is important to know because that is what you will be implementing. In the case of the *Seek, Sense, Share* framework by Harold Jarche, our primary functions are:

1. Seeking Knowledge Sources: This could include seeking valid sources of information, collecting artefacts, storing and organizing artefacts

2. Sensing Knowledge Artefacts: This could include collecting information from the artefact, distilling information, understanding and visualizing information.

3. Sharing Knowledge Artefacts: This could include writing a draft of a your own article, sharing with a friend, or publishing in social media.

## Platforms where there functions will be implemented

Now that we have our functions listed we can easily explore available tools to compare which tool is best fit for the functions. When judging the tools for use, you might benefit from keeping the usability, integration, affordability and sustainability of the tools in mind. 

I have given some examples below.

### Usability of the Platform

Letâ€™s say, I want to choose a search engine or even a browser for seeking knowledge sources. I have a wide range of options from Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari to many other browsers. As well as search engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo. Different search engines usually produce differently indexed sources of information. Different browsers allow different kinds of reading and artefact exporting experiences. A simple act of choosing a browser, and a search engine therefore plays a huge role in what information I see first and access with ease.

### Integration of the platforms   

After usability, I might want to look at how the platform integrates with other platforms. For example, if I want to note information down from PDFs, then I will need at least a PDF reader, a Note-taking App, and a Note Storage App. How these three functions are best implemented depends on how well the platforms that I choose for implementing these functions separately integrate. Let's say, if I have an app that has a PDF reader with a Note Feature and Note Storage, I might not need three different apps at all because they are all integrated (given that the app is usable).

### Affordability of the platforms

Now, let's say I want to use a note-taking app for processing my Knowledge Artefacts. I could go for paid Apple Store, or Play Store Apps such as GoodNotes, free options such as Google Keep, OneNote or Notion, or freemiums such as Evernote. Notice that all these options depend on the usability and integration as well. The affordability of the platform is also codependent on sustainability.

### Sustainability of the Platform

Let's say I have all of my platforms figured out. I start my knowledge management journey. Things are going well, and I have almost five gigabytes of knowledge notes and pdfs stored in different systems. What could go wrong?

What if one of the apps that I use is discontinued. If it's discontinued, it will mean I'll probably have to relocate all my knowledge artefact storage and reintegrate them with the system. 

Let's even say, I don't trust softwares and I prefer keeping hard copy notes. Oneday, there is a rain overflow, and all my books and notebooks could get destroyed in the water-logging. 

This is why platform and sustainability matters a lot.

# The benefits of using a Tool Stack

Rants apart, a Tool Stack has some of the best advantages than an all-in solution. Firstly, there is no All-in Solution yet, and for good reasons. If there is one, that would be cloud storage. Everything can be hosted in the cloud, and performance of cloud solutions are still better and secure than other alternatives. Secondly, a Tool Stack uses a distributed approach, which is why, even if it is needed to reconfigured it can be done easier than changing the whole system. You can even evolve the system slowly by *theseus shipping* your system. 

# Outlook

In this article, we looked at how and why you could choose a Tool Stack for knowledge management. I have only used a single instance of how to implement a Tool Stack, but the best thing is that you have all the freedom to get creative about architecting your own tool stack. I hope the information provided above will help you decide which tools you should pick for your toolstack so that you can manage your knowledge better.

"She was perfect. I swear she was perfect! The keen eyes, the lucid
smiles- everything about her was just enough to make me fall for her
every once in a while. She could read me like no one else. How lucky I
thought I was until doubts started to hit. So I did what I had to. I
stabbed her. With a kitchen knife. Can you even believe me? I am serving
time because I found out about the Turing test. I mean- c'mon man! It
was all silicon all over the place. It was silicons the whole time!"

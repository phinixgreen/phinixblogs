### Deep Waters {#c6e0 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--figure .graf--title name="c6e0"}

[["]{.graf-dropCapQuote}I]{.graf-dropCap} wish I was special."

That was it. He spoke those words to me and plunged into the deep cold
water.

For two weeks and a half, we were trapped together, in a crate full of
bodies. In case you're wondering, we were being smuggled. To someplace
where we would be safe. The SHT1 virus had been spreading inland.

Huddled in the crate, we spoke to each other in whispers. The walls were
closing in, the door would never open, I haven't eaten since yesterday.
The young-lings were wailing in the dark corners. A ray of light would
occasionally sneak in through the cracks of the crate doors.

On the third day, we were let out, we gobbled on the square rations. And
fresh water. Fresh clothes. The engines had stopped. The captain
announced that the ship had been losing fuel for some reason. The mist
was all around so we couldn't see whether it was land nearby where we
had anchored.

I was getting restless.

I had nothing to do, I had nothing to do to pass the time, except to
look up the diary, the moleskin gifted by my sister, how is she I don't
know, will I ever know? I trace the places where my friends had made
their marks of goodbye. I reminisced how on the days of fall, we'd bunk
the classes and go around the town on our own. Near the city estate
zone, there were guitarists who would play like mad crazy men.

I almost started humming the November Rain when a mild splash broke my
train of thoughts. I looked down, in the mist it was almost impossible
to see what it was.

The mist cleared up at night.

The stars were so bright that it cast our shadows on the engine board.
The captain was snoring, and the crew were playing cards. As far as we
could see, it was still waters, going on and on and then merging
somewhere at the dark sky. There was no way of telling where it began
and where it drowned.

The next morning, we realized that a young-ling and one of the older
girls were missing. Where could have they gone? The crew assumed that
they must have fallen off the guards when no one was looking. One of the
kids came to ask me whether there were ghosts in the sea that could come
to eat them. What could I have said to them, except not to worry?

Other than the crew and the captain, I was the second eldest on the
boat. Most of the girls were young-lings, and a few boys. It was an odd
team.

By the fifth day, the engine roared again, and we all returned to the
crate.

"Stay inside and don't come out until we call your names." said the
captain and then he locked us up.

The engine hummed on, for how long god knows. The dull sound bored
through the cranium of mine. Leaning against the cold wall of the crate,
I closed my eyes and tried not to think of what was going to happen to
us. Before the quarantine, before the snow hit the port, all I could
remember were people lying on the streets. They looked as if they have
suddenly decided to sleep on their way to wherever they were going. It
was the silence, the awful silence except a few dogs wailing in the
distance that would keep me awake. Sometimes the alarm would go off and
the military jeeps would rush past the hospital.

In the hospital, a boy from the northern district was admitted as my
cabin mate. He was lanky and spoke in heavy northerner dialect. The boy
was weird, and still I liked him, the time passed well when he was
there. We kissed the day before I left.

When I woke up, I was sweating and my throat was dry. I banged on the
door.

But it was already open from the outside. I took a look at the
young-lings, the engine hum had drowned the sound of banging on the
door. Then, I creeped out of the crate.

The ship was a small one, it was made for the crate only. The stars were
up already, and the sky was so lit that it seemed almost violet in their
light now.

The engine was turned on alright, but the cabins were empty. The
Captain's room was dark and deserted.

For some reason I was not scared. I seemed to be expecting something
like this.

I returned to the crate, closed the door and lied down silently. I am in
a bad dream, and I must wake up properly.

On the Ninth day, they barged in again and let us eat. Everyone ate
without a sound. The captain announced that we'd be arriving within a
few days. We were allowed to stroll around for the day. In the evening,
we returned to the crate.

As usual we were locked down in the crate. The engine roared underneath
us. I cried a little thinking of him. I listened to the darkness inside
the crate. I was angry. And I had nothing to do about it.

Something woke me up. It was one of the crews. The captain wanted to
talk to me.

Groggy eyed, I followed him to the captains quarter.

But the Captain was not there. What was happening? Why have they locked
me in the cabin?

After a while, the Captain and the crews came in. Without letting me
shout, they pinned me on the floor, and started to undress me swiftly.
Things happened too fast from there on.

When one of the crew himself started to undress, and I think I ended up
kicking him where it hurts. He let go of me with a cry, and I freed
myself from the other, bashed on the cabin door and ran through the
corridor. I was running as fast as I could to reach the crate, all I
could tell that when one of them had caught up, I plunged into the water
over the railing without thinking.

When I woke up, I was still feverish and weak. They had found me
floating in the waters.

"You were found entangled with the corpse of a teenage boy." Explained
the doctor.

"And the ship?" I asked.

The doctor seemed perplexed. Should I be perplexed too?

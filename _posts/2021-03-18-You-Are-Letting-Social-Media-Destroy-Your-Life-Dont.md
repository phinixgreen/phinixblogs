Seriously. Don't.

The sites you visit are designed to extract information from you. They
give you a false sense of socialization with minimally controlled
incentives.

Do you like that red notification pop up? Do you like the beep of
messages arriving? Do you like scrolling to the infinite bottom of the
feed?

There is a reason you like to do so.

Even the most layperson among us notices that algorithmic suggestions
show us the things that we like to see.

Why are we, then, in denial of its effects?

Because we are addicted to it.

Unless they try really hard, addicts cannot help themselves to give up
their addiction. It takes a strong will to give up habits that are
harmful. This post is not about which social media you should quit,
rather a general guideline to help you be aware of what you have gotten
yourself into.

#### Knowing the Signs of Good Habits and Bad Habits 

Deciding what is good and what is bad can be quite hard in contemporary
times. For the sake of understanding let us define **Good Habits** as
*patterns of behavior that are hard to acquire*, which don't come to us
naturally, and takes conscious effort to build yet easy to give up.
These habits require our willingness to understand their significance
and effect in our lives. **Bad Habits**, on the other hand, are the
opposite; we pick up these habits almost unconsciously, and become
addicted to them.These are the behaviors that are very hard to give up.
The only thing common between bad habits and good habits is that they
both have long-term consequences in our lives and those around us.

The good news is that, if you are willing to take measures to reduce
your screen-time and improve the quality of your inner life, help is
here.

#### Some Helpful Techniques to Overcome Social Media Addiction 

There is a concept out there that our habits are activated by the way we
interact with our environment. A person who eats a lot, usually has
foods around them that are easily reachable. In our case, we are
activated by the very device that we use ubiquitously. For most of us
who frequently check in to social media sites, Social Media habits are
usually the same .

> We keep our social media apps installed. The notifications are always
> on for messaging services. We often visit social media sites, hoping
> to find something that we cannot describe to ourselves. We pick up our
> phone when we are bored, or don't want to be where we are. If you do
> it too, then you, my friend, should do something about it as soon as
> possible.

**Why?** Let's consider the opportunity cost of these habits. You let
yourself get distracted when notifications hit the bell. You feel
interested to see what's the fuss about. You feel compelled, almost
automatically, to tap your way into the social media site. Once you get
there, you realize that you can't help scrolling a bit, and then a bit
more, and on and on it goes on. The people in your life, wait for you to
respond, your children look at you, but you're absorbed in the device in
your palm, and the people who invited you to talk waits for you to
respond, and ends up behaving the same as you do. In parties, social
gatherings, we don't socialize anymore, we all go sit together and
scroll on and on.

Hopefully, with a little awareness, you can change your habits slightly
to battle this addiction. Here's what I did, and how it has helped me.

#### Deleting Social Media Apps from Cell-Phone 

I think it is safe to announce that I don't have social media apps
installed in my phone. By deleting these apps from my phone, I am making
it harder for myself to tap and jump into the social media . That is, I
have intentionally made the activation potentials lesser than before,
and this successfully alters my behavior of accessing social media. I do
end up re-installing the apps sometimes. But each time I delete those
apps, I am also forcing myself to refrain from reinstalling the apps in
my phone.

#### Turn Off Notifications for the Messaging Apps 

This is a game-changer. I still have some essential messaging apps
installed. The reason for this is mostly because work and networking
culture is gaining momentum in my circles. However, I think most of us
has had these experiences of notifications popping in the middle of
something and effectively interrupting our attention.

I have all my notifications turned off. By doing this, I still get to
see my messages when I am free, but I have more control over my own time
by reducing the possibility to be disturbed by frequent untimely
notifications. Having notifications turned off pays off very well when I
go to sleep, or when I am with my family.

#### Recognize that Social Media (and Your Device) is Basically a Marketing Technique 

Social Media sites are designed in such a way, that they can make you
behave in a predefined scenario (exactly the way designers would want
you to behave). Most users who are frequently available on social media
follow a common user experience flow that invites them to share
information about themselves, even when it's not necessary. A
notification, or a shining app-icon that stands out, or even you,
unconsciously reaching out to the keyboard, is the kind of behavior that
the social media engineers would want you to do. Once you respond to
these leads, you are invited to scroll, until you are compelled to pick
up a call to action: a comment, a share, a like, a decision to
subscribe. These sites even give you subtle incentives when you interact
with them. What all these mean is that the design is effective when you
engage with it constantly. By performing the call to action, you
essentially let yourself fall into the trap of lead generation.

#### Make Use of the Screen Time Monitoring 

I learned this from my partner, who regularly monitors her screen time.
If your device has a screen time monitoring feature, do make use of it.
Seeing how much we waste time and effort on irrelevant pursuits, can
motivate us to change our habits. With some devices, you can limit the
amount of time you spend on social media. Features like these remind you
when you spend too much time in the wonderland, and effectively
interrupting the continuous flow of doom scrolling.

#### Keep the Phone Away 

If you can, put your cell phone away when you don't really need it. If
you keep a fidget spinner in your hand, you will surely be tempted to
play with it. Similarly, having a device that allows for swiping or
tapping, invites you to engage with the lead generating traps. By
putting your phone away, you let the process of accessing social media
be a bit less easy for yourself.

#### Last but not the Least: Smile and Focus on What Needs to be Done 

Social media hardly gives you information that you need. Sometimes it
does let you see what you want, but it is only a sign that the social
media knows too much about you, that such insights are being sold to
countless vendors who hacks your mind and convinces you to buy their
products.

By default we all know that family matters more than social media,
friends matter more than random strangers, and meaningful socialization
matters more than pointless pursuit of interactions. Wisdom has it that
the past cannot be changed, the future cannot always be predicted, but
the present is where we can put effort to change things that matter.

> So don't let irrelevant information distract your purpose, your time
> with family and yourself. Value the people who are there with you, in
> your life. Time is precious, and so is your attention. Share it with
> those who matter, not to things that do not give you anything more
> than perpetual anxiety.

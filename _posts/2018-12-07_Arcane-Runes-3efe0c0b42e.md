1.  [Death is not your enemy. Neither your friend. Do not expect it. Do
    not flirt with it. Do not try running away from it. True Power comes
    from acceptance of Death. The courage to live comes to you only when
    you accept this truth.]{#0355}
2.  [Suffering is inevitable. No one deserves unnecessary sufferings. Do
    not inflict unnecessary sufferings on any living, feeling being. Do
    not inflict unnecessary suffering on yourself. If you see someone
    suffering, be ready to suffer to ease theirs. Do not expect anything
    in return.]{#1675}
3.  [You are always wrong about life. But each mistake you make gives
    you an opportunity to be less wrong.]{#1dea}
4.  [Help others. Learn how to help others so that you can help others.
    Help yourself so that you can help others.]{#b0e8}
5.  [Take care of your health. Avoid anything that is tempting but leads
    only to bad consequences for your health. If someone needs your help
    with help, help them with your knowledge if you have it. If not,
    call for help.]{#baa6}
6.  [Be ready to suffer for others. Do not expect. Do not force your
    help on anyone. Offer your help when they need it most. Be on the
    lookout.]{#0a0c}
7.  [Do not try avoiding sufferings. Do not try getting rid of it. The
    more you avoid sufferings, the more you will desire it.]{#2ef5}
8.  [Know your duties. There is no end to your duties. Know your
    priorities. Know how to learn, so that you can perform your
    duties.]{#4f2b}
9.  [Do not trust anyone. Do not trust anything that involves desire.
    Desire weakens. Desire distracts. Do not desire to do good because
    it makes you happy. Do good, because you do good. If happiness is
    why you want to do good, avoid doing so.]{#bd24}
10. [Do good. Expect nothing. Ignore gratitude or rebuke. Do not trust
    anyone but yourself. Be suspicious of those who plant themselves in
    you. Do not let your-self torn to pieces.]{#7854}
11. [Be transparent. Know yourself. Know what you want, what you desire
    and where you stand. Desire is bad. Keep it caged, even if it causes
    sufferings to you. If your desire compels you to commit harm, pay
    attention to your health. Take sleep. Go somewhere. Take a
    bath.]{#bddc}
12. [Do not aim to achieve. Only do what is before you. Know what to do.
    How to do. When to do. Know enough so you know how to do what you
    have to do when it's your time.]{#1e5a}
13. [If you are desired by others, or you desire others and it causes
    chaos, make peace. Avoid desire at all cost. Abandon if necessary
    and be on your own.]{#4632}
14. [Do not tell to do good. Do not force to do good. Show how to good
    is done. Keep yourself pure. Keep yourself ready. Keep yourself
    sharp.]{#4e7a}
15. [If the bad approaches you, for definitely it will, know why, how
    and what causes it. Do not run. Do not hide. Understand why bad is
    bad. Prevent it before the bad is born. Fight bad if it is near.
    Compensate if the harm is already done. Follow your heart. The heart
    knows well what is good and what is bad. If not, you do not possess
    one.]{#b769}
16. [Do not follow. Do not be blind. See. Move. Observe. Evaluate.
    Think. Act. Think again. Do what is good and strive to do
    better.]{#ab8e}
17. [Do not speak unless you are prompted to. Greet with smiles and wish
    everyone good. Speak what you are asked to answer and not anything
    else. Speak the truth, even if it causes sufferings. Speak truth at
    all cost. Listen and ask for help when you need it. But do not
    expect to be helped.]{#e4ee}
18. [Do not make friends. Be just to everyone. Do not believe
    everything. Believe that people suffer and they need help. Offer
    your help but do not force it. If declined, stay away but do not
    leave. Keep an eye out, for some are unable to ask for help when
    they need it the most.]{#70de}
19. [Never be violent. Never cause chaos. Keep calm. Keep your emotions
    to yourself. If someone offers you help, accept it and show
    gratitude.]{#3f4c}
20. [Know what is important. Sleep if you must. Eat if you must. Let
    others have their share if they are in need of it too. Feel others
    so you know what to do. But do not let yourself become one of them.
    Feel sad about the world. Feel angry at the injustice. Hate
    ignorance. But do not treat people in hurtful ways. Be courteous. Be
    kind. And do not make unnecessary overuse of it.]{#2cea}
21. [The knowledge that corrupts is rogue knowledge. The knowledge that
    misguides you is not knowledge. The knowledge that tells you to
    exploit others is bad knowledge. Know them well. Do not let yourself
    act upon them before you know both sides of the coin.]{#1db7}

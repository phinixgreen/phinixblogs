###  {#b5dd .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--figure .graf--title name="b5dd"}

[I]{.graf-dropCap} sit by the window. Waiting. For her.\
It's raining outside.\
Portland has been flooded for like seven years.\
Makes you kinda wish you had time to build an ark.\
But Noah had his blessings, while we burned down our own house, thinking
it was a fun thing to do.

> "We will fight terror." They said.\
> "We will make our nation proud." They assured.\
> "We will bring justice." They had promised.

Everyone knew they never meant any of that.\
And neither did we want to acknowledge that we had limited rafts at our
disposal.

Such aspirations, we had. Sky-high-scrapers, all the rockets, and
robots, the icarussian dream of spreading the vicious greedy seeds of
humanity into the dead space.

Lewis used to say, when people are afraid, they usually try faking the
opposite. It doesn't say much, except for the fact that they are very
weak inside.

So many great leaders. So many techies to take over the world with cyber
power. The singers sang their hearts out for more forbidden-unrequited
loves. The artists bled paints at the face of genocide and died of
hunger. The activists shouted and shouted, and kept shouting until they
were silenced one by one.

"Don't listen to the hypocrites. We are progressing. Look at the city.
Life is better. There are no insects. No germs. No wild animals. Plenty
of food supply. We are creating a better world."

What they didn't mention was that our better world was getting smaller
every day. And we just couldn't bear to see beyond our comfort zone to
what we were actually doing to this place.

"Well, I don't care." She used to tell me. "As long as I live, and you
love me, I don't care if the world goes down. I want to grow old with
you."

I guess you don't always get what you want. I wonder if she had missed
me when the flood washed her away like rubber duck on Riptide.

There's nothing you can do. Not beyond some point. I could still picture
the days when it would be stormy outside and people would just yearn for
some whiskey and gin in the bar, some dirty fun at the dead of the night
and try their best to forget about the fact that we all will die.
Except, this time, with the planet altogether.

I think of the whales. They kept bobbing up on the shores, full of
plastics. I wonder if that was the beginning. I don't even know where
the beginning was. But I do know that we're at the end. \
 At this point, it doesn't help anymore. Being angry at your ancestors I
mean. For bringing you into it an already ruined world, totally
unprepared and then leaving you without a clue as to what you should do.

But I guess that is what life is. The water's been creeping through the
door. Soon it'll get to the first floor. Is it really rainwater that's
hailing us to death? Or is it just the earth saying us goodbye? You
know, like when people leave, they say "it's been a pleasure serving
y'all." Or is it just crying out of pain, for all the injustice done to
it, centuries after centuries, bottled up? And now it's drowning in its
own tears.

I sometimes think of my own death. And I feel ... strange. To imagine
that your body will run out of oxygen, then drown, then float and rot
without anyone to put you to rest. Your cold dead body, just floating
there, alone...

I keep fiddling with the revolver in my palm. It's quite heavy. Six
bullets, already. Kinda overkill, cause you'll just need only one of em.

But I guess, I'll sit here, by the window for a while. Watching the dull
rain, continuing day after day, the sky coated with tar blackness. I'll
wait here recalling my warm moments with her. That's all I can do as the
last representative of our species on an unfortunate planet that we used
to call Mother Earth.

The sky was red,
And I was staring at the lake like a hobo,
Paint varnishes lay on the tar,
Beside the bench, a baby screaming for his mother, 
The cloud is burning, I told it,
The castle was empty, and we went to see the ruins,
I had to put on a cigarette.
The baby waits for the varnish turn to milk,
No one cares for a hobo,
Or a toddler that has no mother,
Or father, 
I had myself, the sky had the cloud, but the toddler didnâ€™t have itself, 
it was ... a speck of my imagination. 
We gave birth to the cloud, and it was red, and it was burning.

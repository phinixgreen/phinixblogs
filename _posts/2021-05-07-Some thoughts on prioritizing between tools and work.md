The internet is literally crawling with tools that we can use to increase productivity. Does it imply that we should attempt to make the best use of 'All' of these tools as much as we can?

Here's my experience so far. I started out with **Notion** and *Markdown*, then **Github**, then various other tools for *Academic Writing*. My realizations so far have been these -

- I tend to be tool oriented in my work. Which means that I work because I like working with tools, not because I have to work. The upside is that I work as long as I feel like the tool is doing me favor. The downside is also the same. Many seem to call this, 'Shiny Object Syndrome'

- Learning one tool after another takes time. It pays off in the long run. It saves money and it can cost you money. I have tried cheaper methods of productivity and still ended up using expensive productivity software. Learning each tool took a lot of time, from **Emacs** to GUI based apps to countless mobile apps. It takes time. If I did not have plenty of time to spare, I'd stick to one tool that I felt comfortable with.

- Of course it is hard to keep calm and carry on, but work is important. Work is what matters. No one, at the end of the day, will want to see how productive Iâ€™ve been unless there is a result.

- Should we try to use as many tools as possible? It depends on the capacity to learn, really. Some people are comfortable with one tool, others need a whole ecosystem of tools. My approach was to learn one tool at a time, judge its pros and cons, and then either keep it in the toolbox or forget about using it again.

- When there's a lot of work to do, should we try to be productive or get to work first? The best bet here is to start working, and get productive as we go. When I think of being productive, I mean learning tools for getting work done more efficiently. Unless I start my work, I might not know what my needs are, therefore my suggestion would be to start with work first and then try to pin the specific needs that could be automated.

I find I am most productive when I balance between work and learning tools well. The trick is to keep a healthy balance between learning tools for automating the repetitive workflows, and using the mind for more complex tasks.

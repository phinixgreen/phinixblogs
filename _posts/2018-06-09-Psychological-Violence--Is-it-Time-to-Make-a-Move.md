###  {#e6f5 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--figure .graf--title name="e6f5"}

[V]{.graf-dropCap}iolence is a plague that has been haunting humanity
ever since its existence. Acts of Violence happen every day, they are
probably happening right now, and very little has been achieved to
resist the events of violence in our society. By violence here though, I
have meant physical violence ranging from murders, sexual abuse to
psychical offenses.

Take verbal harassment for example. It is by culture accepted that
verbal harassment has no cure, and can only be defended by replying in
the same manner. What happens then is that we promote a kind of abusive
mentality which in turns affect others. There are norms to regulate
psychological offenders, but they do not fall into the category of legal
offenses unless the consequences are severe. Even in the confusion of
cultural and gender perspective, psychological offenses take a firm
ground and continue to persist. For instance, in dating, certain group
if individuals may hold the belief that, being verbally aggressive
attracts a potential mate, whereas, in reality, it ends up creating
psychological trauma in the subject. A similar case happens in certain
scenarios when a certain group of individuals follows the creed of
verbal abuse to affriend others, but it ends up in violent
circumstances.

Some have come up with the solution of social credit, where,
psychological offenses would immediately result in low rating which will
act as a punishment for the offender by barring them from general
privileges and spaces. \

At the moment, tracing virtual interaction remains the most effective
way to identify the nature of psychological offenses. I hold the deep
conviction that cyberbullying is not a resultant phenomenon of the
platforms or individual nature alone but an outcome of both. While
individuals may be inherently or conditioned by social circumstances
show proneness to commit psychological offenses towards others, the
present platforms, by offering them anonymity, allows for freedom to
reach out to anyone and victimize them.

There is another thing needed to consider when dealing with
psychological offenses. Certain individuals with psychological
disability tend to show abusive behaviors towards others. Yet it is a
paradox since many a time it is not clear whether they are a product or
cause of psychological offenses. *While quarantining these individuals
protects others from psychological offenses committed by the prior, it
also denies them the opportunity to heal. It is thus a moral dilemma
when providing a verdict on such cases.*

#### Collective Psychological Offenses {#74ff .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="74ff"}

Collective psychological offenses, which appears in many cases when
masses incur psychological pressure towards certain individuals for
their social mistakes (not a crime) which are not clearly defined and
are subjective to cultural and individual interpretations. These kind of
psychological offenses are not desirable as well since anyone can be a
target of such situations. What is more concerning is that the origin
point of such incitement is extremely difficult to trace and even
condemning or taking punitive actions of the mass offenders will lead to
highly complex retaliations. Thus mass psychological offenses remain an
unsolvable puzzle as much as public lynchings.

#### From Solutions to More Problems {#5151 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="5151"}

There have been many suggestions towards this kind of problems, from
social surveillances to compartmentalizations of all individuals.
However, the solutions themselves often contradict themselves and remain
highly blurry on ethical grounds. For instance, in case of social
surveillance or the awareness of being constantly surveilled may force
individuals into self-regulation, but it may also create a sense of
suffocation, which will bar them from freely approaching others in fear
of committing offenses by miscommunication. Similarly, social
compartmentalization of all individuals of the society may lead to
virtually no offenses, but in practice, they basically take away all the
basic rights of free interaction among individuals.

#### Is it Time to Make a Move? {#b8aa .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="b8aa"}

All these instances only imply that it is extremely challenging to
tackle the problem of psychological violence, and shows why there is a
very little legal regulatory provisions in action to such regards.
However, this does not mean that there shouldn't be any initiatives
towards such problems. As a human collective, we have overcome many
seemingly impossible challenges. It is now a matter of collective
awareness and initiative to resist these manifestations of psychological
violence.

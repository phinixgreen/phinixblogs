The streets are deserted. A neat ray of sunlight made
its way through the morning fog, and hovered over the city. Serenity
enveloped the atmosphere like a thick blanket on the muzzle of a sniper
rifle.

I've been awake for a while, haven't been able to sleep ever since I
woke up hearing someone calling my name. No one ever called me. I didn't
have a name. I give names to myself. I call myself different names
everyday, and I am okay with it. The mannequins don't mind too. I've
never heard them complain.

> One can be in company of many and still be lonely. I am not alone. But
> I sure feel lonely. Terribly, terribly lonely.

Everyday is the same day. Same routine, same thoughts, same blunt anger
that you can't douse. Putting up with these mannequins isn't what I want
to, but I have to.

I'm surrounded by mannequins. This city is full of them. Ruby here, this
plump one, is my current girlfriend. We're supposed to go on a date
tonight. So I drive her to the central park and place her at one of the
empty benches.

On my way back, I see Remmy staring at me. I don't really like him. He's
my neighbour and keeps pissing me off by staring at me when I get out.

But still I force a conversation.

"Hey Rem! Good morning!"

The stupid ass doesn't say anything. I think of punching him.

I sit in my desk at the office and look at all the mannequins in their
perfect attires and perfectly measured smile. Everyone is here, yet no
one is here.

There's a kind of melancholy in that.

So I stare outside, I listen to the wind passing, and I imagine it
speaking to me. Telling me, that there is someone, out there, alive and
warm, like me.

The sky is blue and serene. The bay is clean. The Gulls --- hunting as
usual. But the streets are now infested by mannequins.

Sometimes, I take a stroll to downtown. I go to River's diner, and it's
creeping with those bulky mannequins. I keep forgetting their names.

"Hey yo guys! What're y'all up to?" I greet them jovially.

But what was I thinking, they don't even turn to greet me, just grin at
each other, busy with themselves.

"Oh I see you're busy having lunch together. Bon appetit!"

"lousyshitheads" I think to myself.

I sit at the corner and have my food. I steal glances to look at Rooney
at the counter. She takes order from everyone with her disarming smile!
I tried flirting with her once and got myself disarmed pretty good.

I get back to my desk. When it's past the noon, I start to feel lazy
again.

I doze off in my desk and have a dream. In that dream, I dream of the
very city I live, alive with the people I miss. In that dream, souls
return from the past and rest on the mannequins. And the mannequins
become humans, and they become alive, warm and responsive. In that
dream, I can punch Remmy and he curses me, and I can laugh at him. I can
go to River's store, sit with those awful bunch and actually have some
good time. While we laugh and chat, I can steal a smile at rooney, and
she shyly smiles back. After the lunch when my buddies leave, I can go
and actually tell Rooney that she's really beautiful. And she tells me,
I'm quite handsome too. I ask her out on a date, and she plays with end
of her long brown hairs and looks even more beautiful. Then when she
finally says yes, I jump excitedly and say "Yes!" too.

It must've been getting cold because the dream did not last.

I remember I had a date with Ruby so I drive to the central park and
there she is- right where I had dropped her in the morning.

"Sorry babe!"

"..."

"I'm really sorry. Busy day at work."

"..."

"You missed me, no?"

"..."

"What are we having today?"

"..."

"Oh you're not hungry? or are you still angry at me?"

She seems angry at me. I decide not to annoy her. We sit in the silence
and enjoy the evening view. The sky is blueish orange now. The clouds
have turned purple. The wind is gone and the larks are returning home.
And I am here in this city of my own.

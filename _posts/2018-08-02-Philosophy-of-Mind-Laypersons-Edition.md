`"What is Substance Dualism anyway?"`{.markup--code .markup--p-code}

``` {#3107 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="3107"}
Well, you'll need to understand two concepts to understand the answer to this question.
```

1.  [What is Substance?]{#9011}

AndÂ ...

1.  [What is Dualism?]{#3327}

``` {#b737 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="b737"}
The word Substance in general may mean the things that make up other things.
```

-   [For example, we are made of Hydro-Carbons, a Carbon block is made
    of Carbon atoms, Carbon atoms are made of electrons, protons and
    neutrons and so on.]{#b346}

`These things, which we can touch, feel, sense or prove their existence through measurements are Physical Substances that make up Physical Objects`{.markup--code
.markup--p-code}

-   [So if we are made of Carbons, so is our Brain. You carry your Brain
    all the time with you, and doctors can hold the brain of a person
    during operation or weigh it after their death (Don't gross out
    please!). So we can pretty much confirm that a Brain is a *Physical
    object*.]{#bae0}
-   [Scientists have dissected the brain (of dead people of course) and
    have found out that it is made of neurons, and neurons are made up
    of complex Hydro-Carbons. These are also *physical
    substances*.]{#3e0b}

``` {#f29e .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="f29e"}
Dualism comes from the word Dual, which means two, 
And the -ism means the belief that there are two kinds of things.
```

-   [Some people believe that our **Brains** may be physical objects
    which we can touch or feel, but the **Mind** which is what you and I
    are, along with our memories, emotions, beliefs, perception, and
    thoughts about ourselves and other things, all of these are
    **Non-Physical Substances**, because they cannot be touched or
    measured in any way that reveals that they are made up of *physical
    substances*]{#a12c}
-   [People who believe that there are two categories of substances,
    namely **Physical Substances** and **Non-Physical Substances** are
    believers of **Substance Dualism**]{#0de1}

`"What are the claims of a Substance Dualist?"`{.markup--code
.markup--p-code}

A typical substance dualist may argue:

1.  [Minds can do things like understand and use **Language**, but
    physical objects can't.]{#cf00}
2.  [One can use **Logic**, but a stone cannot?]{#946c}
3.  [Or the mind is **Conscious**. Physical objects like Computers and
    Pens are not!]{#3e78}

`But Substance Dualists may also face these objections`{.markup--code
.markup--p-code}

1.  [The Mind can sure use language, but so does "Google" otherwise it
    won't be able to provide the search results.]{#2841}

Or,

1.  [The device I am using to right now to read this write-up is
    constantly using complex logic to bring me the result I desire and
    it seems clearly a physical object to me which is capable of using
    logic.]{#e428}

But then the substance dualist may play their best card-

> "Well, google can use language, and computers can use logic, but they
> sure aren't conscious, are they?"

This is where **Philosophers of Mind** have parted ways in their
explanation. But one can still argue reasonably well against the theory.
For instance, one can say-

1.  [Well, the mind is conscious, and it is a non-physical object. But
    according to Substance Dualists, the Brain, which is a physical
    object, is not conscious. But if someone is severely hit in the
    brain, why do they fall unconscious then?]{#2fc3}

The substance dualist may claim a **Causal Relationship** between the
**Mind** and the **Brain** that is -

> "The Mind and Brain can interact with each other"

But then,

`"How does the Mind and Brain interact with each other?"`{.markup--code
.markup--p-code}

-   [We know that we have a **Brain** with us which weighs and is
    clearly a physical object, and we also have a **Mind** otherwise we
    won't be able to think and have memories, right?. So-]{#3661}

> "How does a **Non-Physical Substance** like the *Mind* and **Physical
> Substance** like the *Brain* interact with each other?"

Substance dualists have hit a dead end here. So far, there has not been
a satisfactory answer that appeals to the logical framework.
Philosophers have largely turned to other explanations and theories of
mind, such as **Physicalism** and have abandoned the **Substance
Dualism**

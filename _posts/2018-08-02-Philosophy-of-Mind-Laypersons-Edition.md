`"What is Substance Dualism anyway?"`


> Well, you'll need to understand two concepts to understand the answer to this question.


1.  What is Substance?

AndÂ ...

2.  What is Dualism?

 
The word Substance in general may mean the things that make up other things.


-   For example, we are made of Hydro-Carbons, a Carbon block is made
    of Carbon atoms, Carbon atoms are made of electrons, protons and
    neutrons and so on.

`These things, which we can touch, feel, sense or prove their existence through measurements are Physical Substances that make up Physical Objects`

-   So if we are made of Carbons, so is our Brain. You carry your Brain
    all the time with you, and doctors can hold the brain of a person
    during operation or weigh it after their death (Don't gross out
    please!). So we can pretty much confirm that a Brain is a *Physical
    object*.
-   Scientists have dissected the brain (of dead people of course) and
    have found out that it is made of neurons, and neurons are made up
    of complex Hydro-Carbons. These are also *physical
    substances*.

 
Dualism comes from the word Dual, which means two, 
And the -ism means the belief that there are two kinds of things.


-   Some people believe that our **Brains** may be physical objects
    which we can touch or feel, but the **Mind** which is what you and I
    are, along with our memories, emotions, beliefs, perception, and
    thoughts about ourselves and other things, all of these are
    **Non-Physical Substances**, because they cannot be touched or
    measured in any way that reveals that they are made up of *physical
    substances*
-   People who believe that there are two categories of substances,
    namely **Physical Substances** and **Non-Physical Substances** are
    believers of **Substance Dualism**

A typical substance dualist may argue:

1.  Minds can do things like understand and use **Language**, but
    physical objects can't.
2.  One can use **Logic**, but a stone cannot?
3.  Or the mind is **Conscious**. Physical objects like Computers and
    Pens are not!

`But Substance Dualists may also face these objections`{.markup--code
.markup--p-code}

1.  The Mind can sure use language, but so does "Google" otherwise it
    won't be able to provide the search results.

Or,

1.  The device I am using to right now to read this write-up is
    constantly using complex logic to bring me the result I desire and
    it seems clearly a physical object to me which is capable of using
    logic.

But then the substance dualist may play their best card-

> "Well, google can use language, and computers can use logic, but they
> sure aren't conscious, are they?"

This is where **Philosophers of Mind** have parted ways in their
explanation. But one can still argue reasonably well against the theory.
For instance, one can say-

1.  Well, the mind is conscious, and it is a non-physical object. But
    according to Substance Dualists, the Brain, which is a physical
    object, is not conscious. But if someone is severely hit in the
    brain, why do they fall unconscious then?

The substance dualist may claim a **Causal Relationship** between the
**Mind** and the **Brain** that is -

> "The Mind and Brain can interact with each other"

But then,

`"How does the Mind and Brain interact with each other?"`

-   We know that we have a **Brain** with us which weighs and is
    clearly a physical object, and we also have a **Mind** otherwise we
    won't be able to think and have memories, right?. So-

> "How does a **Non-Physical Substance** like the *Mind* and **Physical
> Substance** like the *Brain* interact with each other?"

Substance dualists have hit a dead end here. So far, there has not been
a satisfactory answer that appeals to the logical framework.
Philosophers have largely turned to other explanations and theories of
mind, such as **Physicalism** and have abandoned the **Substance
Dualism**

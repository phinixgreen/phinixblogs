## 1.

“You’re all bunches of idiots.” Beida says in her usual complacent tone. 

“Look at them. All these idiots, buying expensive lattes and designer mochas. They just stroll around tasting stuff.”

Raymon didn’t need to look around. 

AlCafe was packed with the usual crowd. The morning-light penetrated through the ceiling’s glass and lit the shop up into a comfortable aura. People were walking around with color changing desserts in their hands.

Comfort was everywhere. It was there in the short queues, before the transparent screens, in the faces of the cheerful ladies making orders. Comfort was in the cozy corners, in the excited voices of the teenagers feasting on piles of synthetic desserts. People were talking all over the place, bingeing in their lively conversations. Young couples were roaming aimlessly, they could be seen scattered all around the place, sipping drinks and chatting the endless leisure away, comfortably.

“What’s wrong with that? We’re living the best of our lives.” Raymon says.
“You don’t get it. That’s the point. Nobody gets it”
“You’re right. I don’t get you.”
“Have you ever tried doing anything in your life?”
“What are you even talking about? Look around. People are free. We get universal basic incomes. We don’t need to work. This shop produces all the things we need in the morning. We have food. We feel good. We go to the market, or to the magazine shop to get new ideas. We decorate our lives. How could you say that we’re not doing anything in our lives? We’re enjoying our lives to the fullest!”

It was true. Dhaka was the perfect utopia. People no more woke up to read news about murders, fraud and rapes. Those things don’t exist anymore. No one even knows what they meant. The words crime, poverty and corruption have been erased from the dictionary for good. Even the dictionary wasn’t needed anymore. Why would it be? No one was required to study, no schools, college or university, no struggle with careers, no one needed worrying about running families, or businesses. No. No need for those. They were truly free from all the struggles of life. The shops didn’t need human salespersons, transports didn’t have any drivers, industries and farms didn’t need laborers or farmers, nothing was run by humans anymore. It was all automated.

“That’s why you’re all bunches of idiots. You never do anything.” says Beida. “Machines
do everything. All you “Do” is just eat. Don’t you ever feel ‘farmed?’”

“Farmed? Never thought like that.”
Beida gives her typical raised-brow-over-the-glasses look at Raymon.

“I hate when you do that!” Raymon chuckles.
“What else do you hate?”
“Well, I don’t really hate anything. I’m too comfortable. Except… the fact that… I don’t ..kind
of think of doing anything -’Extraordinary’”
“Exactly what I’m talking about! All the innovations come from nowhere. We’re not really doing anything. All the things I need today, get solved the next day. How? Ever wondered that?”

Raymon paused his sip to look at Beida. How does she even think of these things? Beida was like this. Or so he remembered. Ever since he knew her, she has been complaining about everything.

“I don’t get it how everything is so nice and smooth!” 
She complained about everyone being everyone, as if it was a crime. Most of all, she liked to complain how her brother, Daza, was an idiot, “obsessed with a piece of wood for nothing” she’d say.

It was funny because until now, Raymon had never considered those things as something odd.

“Why are you being so restless Beida?”

The young lady in her mid twenties looked back at him, melancholy brimming in her eyes. She leans forward and almost whispers to him- “Raymon, I think, there is something wrong with everything. And I’m going to find out why.”

“What..how do you mean?”
“For one, have you ever heard of anyone crossing the perimeters of the city?”
“Yeah of course…. Wait… No.”
Raymon gets confused. A smile appears slowly on Beida’s face.
“No one thinks of crossing the perimeters.”
“Why would we, we have everything here. All the things we need are here. We’ve got shops and markets, malls and supermalls, galleries and chain shops. What else could there be out there? It’ll probably be the same thing over and over again, all over as long as one can go.”

“But why is there a perimeter then?”
“Maybe to keep things out. I mean, we’re safe here, aren’t we? Maybe some unknown thing is out there that shouldn’t be let in.”
“What could be out there, that we don’t need to know?”
“You ask too many questions, don’t you? How do you even come up with this stuff? My
head hurts thinking of them.”
Beida sipped at the mug of synthetic coffee that she held in her palms like a newborn, clearly thoughtful.

## 2.

Outside Alcafe, the sky was smeared with grey clouds and swirling of fog. To an outsider, the air would smell faintly of stale gasoline. People were used to it. So was Raymon. The smell hardly bothered him. What bothered him were the urban magpies. These winged little creatures were abundant in the locality. They were perhaps the only creatures that could see the city as it is. 

Raymon often imagined being one- gliding free, watching over the city expanding in mosaics of concretes and black-tar, squares forming more squares, here and there patchworks of greenery, a handful dots moving along the streets, no cars, no crowd, just the city — a blissful peace in a living breathing graveyard of oblivion. 

After parting from Beida, Raymon took the central Hyperloop to east-town. He wanted to talk to Daza about her.

Daza. Daza probably wouldn’t be interested. He rarely took interest outside his music. Tell him you noticed how the girl next door smiles when she sees him, he’d probably yawn and say “Yeah, she’s kinda cute.” Tell him she fancies his new guitar, and he’d jump up and keep pacing around you making hundreds of queries about her interests.

04–40 Daza’s Den wasn’t a den at all. 

It was just a duplex cottage surrounded by a neatly kept garden. The Bamboo walls were covered with synthetic varnishes. They gave it a glossy look. Daza sometimes complained meekly that it was too nice to live.

The door opened as Raymon approached it. As he stepped into the house, a loud noise of something wooded smashing came from somewhere nearby. Raymon jumped. If there was anything Raymon hated about Daza, it was his quirky habit of smashing guitars. As he recovered from the start, he realized Daza was done with his yellow Les Paul that he bought some time ago.

“Finished?” asked Raymon as Daza turned.
A cleaner bot was wiping the debris.
“Finished.” Grinned Daza.

The young man was lean, almost the size of Raymon. He wore a sweaty red Bandana and a black t-shirt that said “Watch for Peace”. He stood in a medium square room surrounded by racks full of guitars- baroque acoustics, Semi-Electrics, Antique-Bass, — it could easily pass for a museum collection. 
Apart from the diminishing odor of Daza’s sweat, the room smelt heavily of varnished bamboo and wood.

“What’s next?”
“I have to find out. Perhaps a fretless-metalhead or plastic-singer, a bit flashy, a bit louder. I’m suddenly craving for a mix of liquid-metal sound.”

“Let’s get you one from someplace outside the perimeter?”
“Perimeter? Hosh! What’s that?”
“You know- erm, where the city ends?”
“Where the city ends?”
“You’ve never been there?”
“I’ve never even thought of that.”
“Want to think of it now?”
“But I can get one from here, at the Almusica, they’ve got tons of guitars, and fa-”
“-do you wanna go with me?”
“Why would I? I’m already tired.” Yawns Daza.
“Because, your-”
“My…?”
“Your…”

Daza stares at Raymon.

“Are you tired?”
“Just lost the stream of thought.”
“You were asking about the perimeter. Where no one needs to go.”
“Oh. Yeah. Well, I think I was going to ask you why no one thinks about the perimeter.”
“No one needs to. We have everything here.”
“What if you needed something that’s not here?”
“What could I possibly need that’s not here?”
“You know, like… erm… “
“What’s gotten into you today?”

Raymon glanced at the wall, which silently played music videos. A city full of cottages, streets where people walked with smiles dabbed at their faces, everyone happy, everyone so satisfied that it suddenly made Raymon feel sick. 

He didn’t know the word though, the word “Sick” was deinvented long ago.

“So you say nothing ever seemed- out of place to you?”

“Well…” Daza itched at his chin “The bots are pretty clumsy, and the den varnish is kind of off sometimes, but I get all I need, I get the credit, I go buy my things, I come back, I storm the guitar. You know the cycle. The only time I get pissed off is when, I can’t seem to satisfy myself with a guitar for long. I feel pretty…pretty…”
“You can’t seem to find the word.”
“I can’t seem to find the word.”
“Do you want to find what you’re looking for?”
“I’m looking for a new guitar.”
“Aren’t you hopeless”
“I could say the same for you”
“Yeah well I’m gonna visit Luba”
“Imma head for Almusica. Give my love to your sister”


## 3.

Luba’s place was just twenty minutes away from Daza’s. It was almost same as Daza’s cottage, except the whole garden was more verdant with different shrubs and plants. Raymon never understood Luba’s obsession for plants, he never gave much thought about plants, they seem to take care of themselves, and devoting time to take extra care of those seemed pretty pointless to him.

The door opened itself as he reached it, and a cool, familiar stream of air ushered him in. He knew Luba would be in the backyard, where she is most of the time, talking to trees and sprinkling water.

“Hey brother!”
“Hey”
“Where’ve you been?”
“At Alcafe”
“With Daza?”
“Nah. Just by myself”
“Oh. Anyways. Come over here. I’ve got some new blooming Hibiscus.”
“Looks good.” Raymon says.
“Looks amazing!”
“What’s that?” Raymon points to a large stick with a flat roundish point metalhead.
“That? That’s a shovel”
“What’s that for?”
“Oh. You can dig with it.”
“Digging with a stick? Don’t you have excavator-bots?”
“I have two of them.” Luba points at Raymon’s back. Raymon turns to see two greenish
excavator bot standing by.

“Why not use them?”
“This is more fun.” Luba picks up the shovel and drives it into the soil near her feet.

“Watchout!” Raymon steps back in alarm.
“Hehe” Luba grins with her dimples showing.

“But that’s dangerous!”
“But it’s so fun!” She giggles. “Why visit me out of the blue, though?”

“I am going to the perimeter”
“Sounds fun”
“Tag along with me?”
She looks around, looking for an excuse.
“Luba?”

The plants rustle against each other, as the cooler door opens and the ceilings wrap themselves up to let more sunlight in. Blankness filled her eyes as the green mosses changed their color to purples, the yellow money-plants turned blue.

“Luba?”
“Oh brother!” she says “I wish I could, but Saiju’s coming”
“I wish I had a date” Raymon pretended to be serious. Luba rolled her eyes.
“Just kidding! Just kidding!” He grinned.



## 4.

Raymon took the Hyperloop again. The comfortable mini-capsules that get deployed from the Robot Industrial Park sitting at the center of the city travelled through the network of vacuum tubes underneath the surface. They were fully automated.

This time a speeding capsule took him through the middle Panthaps to Rescurma, made a detour turn at Carzhall and stopped at the Nemarka. The perimeter lay west to the landmark.

The Nemarka was filled with shabby left out artifacts, visages of an ancient city lying in rubble. A tall tower from some long forgotten time stood with naked humility, watching over the algae covered ruins of abandoned buildings. Ferns all over the place, purple and yellow, green. 

A leaked drainage system overflowed and flooded the surface in places.

Damp air surrounded Raymon, filling with methaneous smell which reeked from the drenched soil as he made each new step towards the perimeter.

How long he walked, he wasn’t sure. He glanced against his shoulder, and the tower could still be seen. The sun was almost sinking. Above him, a flock of urban magpies were in silent retreat. 

But why was he here, he didn’t know. He wanted to find something out, find someone. What was he looking for? What didn’t he know, what was he supposed to know? Was this the right place to know what he didn’t know. And now he questioned if it was even important to know?

Irritated, Raymon turned back. By the time he reached the foot of the tower, it was already dark. Although his bionic eyes flicked and adjusted to the nightly environment, he felt an eerie sensation he had never felt. He had no name for it. He could make a voice command and an emergency unit would rush to pick him up.

But Raymon was thinking of something else. The irritation turned into a drunk rage, he was angry, and he became angrier because he didn’t know why he was angry. Why does it have to be like this? This life? He didn’t have any word for it. There was something that he could sense, yet, it’s as if he was never trained to do it, he never knew how he came to the city, for as long as he remembered, he had been here, in this city, having coffee, going to marts and buying this, and saving universal income for that, and then spending on another, then onto something else. It all seemed too ridiculously pointless to him.

Anger swelled in him and a yellow point at the corner of his field of vision started pointing that he needed to calm down. Distraught Raymon touched his neck to turn off his communication with the central server.

All his comms went down in a second. The bionic vision went static so he turned it off as well. For how long Raymon groped in the dark he didn’t know, but his organic vision finally adjusted with the darkness, and he was amazed to find the result. The world around him was bathed in the pale white light from something overhead. As long as he remembered, he rarely thought of looking up to see the round dish shaped object. The moon, he faintly remembered, was a satellite that served no purpose in his life, and no one ever cared to look at it.

But now, this very overlooked thing, guided him to someplace, someplace where he would find his answer to everything. He arrived at an old junction of downhill roads and pressed further, until he passed a shrine of an ancient man, then another with rectangular heads and bars, then another with several men huddling against each other’s back. 

Where the hell was he going, he had no idea, but he didn’t care either.

But he had to, when he tripped over something, and before he could grope in the darkness to see what it was, an alarm went off with a strobing light. The darkness around him suddenly blazed into almost daylight.
What it was, he didn’t have time to think. 

He began running, stepping onto whatever he could guess coming his way, until he was out of the reach of the unnerving light and sound.

As the alarm died off into the distance, Raymon found himself in front of a two storied square, no windows, just a staircase, inviting him to discover something that he had been restlessly looking for.


## 5.

“I don’t get it.”
“Are you even listening?”
“You’re saying there is a thing, with things, with things about… things?”
“It was called a library. And yes, it’s supposed to store books”
“Weird names I never heard of”
“Because there is not one in the mart. I’ve searched through and through.”
Daza stared at the strange block in his friend’s hand.
“How come it stores information? It doesn’t seem electro-organic. It looks like…stuff made
out of dead trees.”
“Quite so.”
“How do you know?”
“When I entered that staircase, something moved inside the cube. I followed the source,
and ended up in a large room, full of dusty tables and racks.

With a low hum, the lights came on, one by one, and I found myself in a graveyard of
history. A screen came on. In it - a man's face welcomed me.
“What place is this?”
“Welcome to National Public Library of Dhaka, Sir”
“What’s a ‘National Public Laibrai’?”
“It’s Library, sir.” said the man on the screen with a smile. “and please, call me, Pro.”
“Pro?”
“Pro for Prometheus, Sir. Prometheus was a mythic God who stole fire from the Gods and
introduced its use to the human beings”
“You talk funny.”
“And you seem to have lots to learn?”
“Learn what?”
“Take a look around.”
I walked down the hallway, to the racks, weird signs and symbols inscribed in each. I touched the rack, careful not to set off another alarm. There were thousands of pieces of ‘Books’ like the one I’m holding right now. As I held it in my hands, the thing parted like this-“

Raymon showed how to open a book to his friend.
“Whoa that’s horrible. What happened here!”
“I tried to wash the dust in a sink at the library, I didn’t know these things were organic. Like you said, made from dead woods.”

Daza squinted at the pages, he flapped several, sniffed the paper, played his fingers over
the letters and words and said “-but I don’t get it. How could they store information in it?
It’s not playing anything.”

“Exactly what I thought first. It’s unbelievable. It came to me that this was some elaborate hoax, maybe I was just sleeping and having some weird dreams, but this was too suspicious to be false. For one, take a look at this-“ Raymon flipped the pages and stopped at one where there were pictures of ancient buildings, square shaped, rectangular and unusually tall.

“What are these?”
“These were called skyscrapers. People built these, with their own hands. Can you even believe it? But notice these?” Raymon pointed at the images of the banks, restaurants, schools, and government buildings all displaying their names.

“Weird. I never saw anything like those hanging anywhere.”

Daza was right. All the marts, shops, coffeehouses and stations never had any text displayed. Everyone just knew what they were, and they just mentioned it as if they had always known them.

“It’s because they aren’t needed. No one reads books. No one needs to. And no one knows how to read.”

“Read. You mean understand these symbols? Isn’t it kinda ancient?”
“Ever asked yourself where we have come from?”
“I am asking myself where the hell that kind of question is coming from?”
“Exactly” said Raymon as he looked at Daza with intensity.

“You’re mad. You’ve gone mad. Why did you even go to the perimeter?”
“Mad? Have you ever seen anyone mad? Do you even know where that kind of words
come from? Word? See these symbols? They are words. They word we speak- they come
from here. And yet we do not know how.

The ancient people had this thing called the government. They selected one of them to lead
them. The people would work to make food, build cottages, and make -machines to live on.
And still there were things called sickness, war, poverty, and people-“

“Hey, hey hey, slow down, slow down, what the hell are these things you’re talking
about?”
“Poverty is…say.. the credits we get is enough to live, have coffee, buy the things we need
or do right?

Now imagine, you need those stuff, but other people have it, but they won’t give it to you,
and you can’t buy any, so you can’t do anything, and feel bad, like really bad, and that’s
sickness, you might even hit me, because you need to recover from it, otherwise you
will…you will be something else.. you will not “exist”- that’s death.”

“But those things never happen here. Why are we even bothered?”
“But there were other things- like ‘sufferings’, ‘meaning of life’, ‘pursuit of truth’ — people actually spent time thinking about it. What do we do? We shop when we are bored, when we’re tired we grab coffee, when we are hungry we get food and when night falls we go to sleep. There’s no ‘meaning’ in it. We are just machines.”

“But there must be someone who is running all these.. I mean-“
“-There you are, finally getting what I’m saying” Raymon beamed at his friend upon his
realization.

## 6.

The night fell quickly and Dhaka lit up with fancy lighting- courtesy of the marts and coffee-shops. The streets were a little wet from the early evening rain, and flapping of urban magpies could be heard overhead, if anyone were keen on hearing.

Distant from the Almusica, someone hid behind an empty dumping crate. Another hooded figure could be seen approaching.

“Psst!”
“Psst! Daza?”
“Yeah. You ready?”
“Yeah. Sorry, I went to get the shovel. What did you get?”
“I got nothing but one of the surviving metal-head guitars of mine.” He showed off its
blunt head.

The two sneaked through the gardens and shadows. The plan was simple. In the ancient days, there were governments and laws, and those who broke laws were punished. There were some who would break law for the “greater good.” The others would simply enjoy “freedom”.

Raymon had been sneaking into the abandoned library to smuggle ideas into the city. 

Daza wasn’t too keen, but he was indeed amazed by the possibilities these ideas offered. Violence had destroyed cities after cities, until men invented something. Something that brought the wars to an end. And since then, there have been no records of human beings involved in thinking. If Raymon was correct, there is indeed a government, hiding somewhere, controlling everything, making things run smoothly. And so, they wanted to start a commotion to see what happened to the violators of law. 

And what place better than to start from the Robot Industrial Park. Except that they didn’t know where exactly it was. 

But Raymon had found a way.

He had been tracing the tubes to see where they met. Turns out, they intersected some place under Almusica. Plus, there was an abandoned shaft tunnel which probably had been used for maintenance work.

Daza prepared the way Raymon had instructed him beforehand. 

He switched off his comms with the central servers, and his bionic vision went down. At first, he couldn’t make out the world around him. His head felt blunt. His vision got foggy. Low vibration statics hummed in his ears. Still, it felt good. A warm feeling spread through his veins, perspirations appeared in his forehead, adrenaline rushed all over his body, pumping his heart with raging blood, he wanted to do something. He definitely felt like he could do something.

The two of them climbed down the tunnel entrance and found themselves in a small room. The walls were old. Soot gathered everywhere, cobwebs surrounded the ceiling. 

“Hey! Ray. I think someone’s been here.”

Raymon squinted. It was true. At the right side corner, there was a door slightly open, letting breeze flow in from the other side. They raised their weapons, ready to hit if anything approached them.

“Man! This is crazy. I’ve never done this before.”
“Shh. Do you hear that?”
Daza paused and listened. It was not a sound. It was a collection of different sounds.
Grating, thumping, bumping. Mechanical voices could be heard, clicking, tinkling.
Screeching. Blinking. Clinking.

With some effort, Raymon pushed the door further open and they ended in a long corridor. At the far end, there was another door, glazing in the raw darkness. The sounds got louder as they approached it.

Halfway through, Raymon felt something stinging in his arms. He made a low grunt. So did
Daza. Something small were buzzing around them, whizzing past their sweaty arms and
shoulders.
“What the hell!”

“They’re called mosquitoes. I’ve read that they caused illnesses.”

“Damn these little pricks” Daza said through his gritted teeth and slapped his shoulder.

An alarm went off instantly.

“What the hell!
“What did you do?”

“Your mosquito bit my shoulder, I slapped it.”
“You turned on your comms idiot! Let’s rush!”

“Which way?!”
“What d’you mean which way?”
“I am gonna bash some robots. I didn’t come this far to go back.”
“No you idiot!”

But it was too late. Daza sprinted through the door. Raymon heard him scream, he had
never heard Daza scream. Bashing sounds came, wood breaking, metal banging, the
sounds intensified, alarms still buzzing and ringing in Raymon’s ears.

Raymon did not know what to do. The alarm got louder. He was considering a retreat
without Daza when his renegade associate came running through the door.

“Let’s go!”
“What did you do?!”
“What we were supposed to do!”

“Great! Now they’ll come for us! This was supposed to be a sabotage!”
“Too late to think of it! Let’s go!”

Raymon and Daza climbed up the ladder and landed on the surface. Both of them now panted heavily.

“Idiot!”
“You’re the better one”
“What do you think they’re doing? Are they searching for us?”
“How would I know?”
“Let’s go back.”
“Wait!”
The duo abandoned their clothes and ditched their weapons. They took off the shoes and waited in the shadows to see if someone came to arrest them. Was it the thrill or the stillness of the night, they weren’t sure, but it seemed like hours had passed but nothing had changed. No one had come looking for them.
“I’m tired. I can’t stay anymore. Let’s go back.” said a pale faced Daza.


## 7.

Raymon woke up with his hairs full of soot. 

His face was sweaty and his right hand felt numb. Gummy mouth, he picked himself out of a mess on the bed. He limped to the mirror to see his forehead swollen from a cut. His pants were full of dirt and his shirt was nowhere to be found.

What had happened last night?
He didn’t know.
Who was he with? Where did he go? How did he get the cuts?

For all he knew, he had been sneaking into an ancient building, a library. He had been reading books, World Atlas, Art of War, Homo Deus, Anna Frank’s Diary, The Quran, Paradise Lost. They spoke of their ancestors. The ones who gave birth to another flesh and blood. The ones who aged and died. The ones who suffered yet lived better than he did.

But what could have made him end up like this?

He had never felt anything like this. The searing pains. The blunt headache, the itching, the little burning scars all over his body. He limped towards the direction of the library, passing the familiar points. The more he went on, the alien everything started to seem. It felt as if the buildings were themselves disappearing, and then reappearing in some other place, there were static sounds all around him. Low pitched pings and blinks were coming from the inside of his head.

He felt angry. He felt cheated. Raymon wanted to know, he knew something was done to him, but who, he had no idea. And this idea itself enraged him more. On his way, urban magpies sat on the walls, they sat on the trees, they stared down at him from the corners of the roof, as if he were a christ making his way towards the cross.

It hurt. But Raymon dragged himself. Something told him that it was waiting for him at the
library. Waiting for him to confront it. Find the truth. Yes. He will find it.

But there was nothing.

There were no libraries, no buildings. Nothing. It was just a plain surface. Someone had come and neatly removed the whole thing as if it was never there.

Raymon was confused. He looked around. He stomped on the ground. He stirred the rocks and rubbles. But there was nothing that testified the existence of an entire building.

And then flashbacks started flooding his wake.

Daza had suddenly hurled himself over him, trying to hit him, gagging him to death. In the shadows, they had wrestled, rolled and tossed over ground, staggered up, again and then locked into another struggle. Raymon had to scratch his dear friend’s face, and as Daza tried to reach for the shovel, he drove his fingers into the eyes and a shrill scream erupted, the pain obvious. Even still Daza kicked Raymon, and Raymon-by this time knew he had to save himself, he launched at the shovel, picked it up, brought it down on Daza’s head, again, and again, until the blood bathed body went limp, permanently.

No one came to save them from what they had done to each other. Only the urban magpies that never slept watched with eyes wide open. Staring at the battleground, the victim and the victor lying in their own mess.

Was it the comms? Was it the magpies? The inner devil? Where had Beida gone, he didn’t know. What was happening to them? To everyone who questioned the utopia without a governor? What the hell at all?

Raymon felt nauseated. He wanted to roll down and pour out. Out of habit, he unconsciously turned on his comms with the server. All he had these questions, and the answers blurred themselves in his throbbing head.

The neurons began to rearrange their patterns, slowly, the enzymes spread, so did the hormones, and the nanobots flooding his vein initiated their due operation.

A figure could be seen approaching him. A lady. She looked familiar. Where had he seen
her?
“Saiju? What happened to you? Why did you call me here?” she asked.
“I was…lost.”
“You look horrible! Let’s go home. I got some new color changing money-plants for my
garden, you like the color changing ones, don’t you Saiju?”
“I do.”
“I can’t seem to find my shovel though. You don’t know anything about it, do you?”

Urban magpies circled over them. The threats have been eliminated, the specimens have been recovered, potential hazards have been removed, and the assets have been reprogrammed.

“Nope” Saiju smiled.

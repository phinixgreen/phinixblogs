Most people who know or have heard the name of Einstein hold him in great esteem, even though they have very little how deeply great his contributions were to humanity. That is the difference between Mediocrity and Greatness. Each is an entirely different world, and alien to the inhabitants of the other.    


Mediocrity, Success and Greatness, these are abstract concepts. A common nature of abstract terms is that they are easy to understand, hard to define. We agree which is what, but we cannot explain why things are so.


Fortunately, Mediocrity, Success and Greatness all have characteristics that give off a signal on who is what. When asked to identify the wisdom of the crowd, we are quick to give a verdict on mediocrity. Yet, when asked to point out a truly mediocre person, we are doomed to fail.


I see this as an interesting phenomenon. Mediocrity is a collective attribute, and not an individual one. Commonplace behavior such as pouting when taking selfies, or spending time in social media, or binging on Netflix, engaging in small-talk, these are some of the often cited mediocre behavior. Infact, a behavior becomes mediocre when it is widely replicated.


Does this have any implication for being successful? Depends on how we see success. What is the difference between a person who is truly genius, leaves a vast treasure of knowledge in plain sight, and a person who rises to fame leveraging on mediocre behavior. Two entirely different domains of talent. Those who leverage mediocre behavior are themselves not mediocre, they simply make use of mass interests. A silent genius on the other hand, is too busy creating value, to focus on leveraging mediocre behavior. Who is more successful?


Hard to say. The person who leverages mediocre behavior, no doubt a talent, is incredibly social, has wide networks and outreach. Yet, when it comes to subject matter, they are far from a genius' depth of knowledge. What about the genius? Success, it seems, has a price for them as well. The extremely deep roots of knowledge, the fringe domains of interest and insightful way of thinking falls short in social interaction. Very few take interest in what they have to say.
    
We often equate success with greatness. Possibly because success is associated with quantity. But greatness is not just about quantity. It has an intrinsic quality that makes it stand out from success.    


Take a rickshaw puller for example, who rises to fame for being a viral singer. The momentary greatness that gave everyone joy, soon becomes commodified, and now fame may define their sudden success, but it does not guarantee continuation of greatness.
    
That brings us to the fundamental difference between mediocrity and greatness. Mediocrity demands us to be mediocre for the sake of pleasing mediocre behavior. It limits our potentials to what we could be. Greatness on the other hand is unbound and limitless. Socrates was famously said to have claimed that he knew he was a wise man because he knew that he knew nothing. Greatness is attained when we are open to possibilities. The pursuit of greatness takes us out of our comfort zone, that boundary within mediocre practices.  


Unfortunately, the path to greatness has always been solo. Great minds, who surfed the fringes of the sea of knowledge, were often misunderstood, or even isolated. By thumb rule, no human is mediocre, and every human being is at some stage of greatness. We now turn to the four stages in the pursuit of greatness.
    
The first stage is characterised by loneliness. We intuitively realize that there is something unique in us, that others fail to understand or even value. We can choose to be mediocre by abandoning this uniqueness for the sake of immediate success and gratification. Interestingly, when we are immersed in mediocre behavior, we are the happiest and most ignorant. Most people would desire this state. Yet, when they return home, they realize that something was not understood, and therefore they crave to be understood for those parts. For these reasons, loneliness is perhaps the most universally common state of mind.


However, some people choose to follow their instincts and pursue the unique things they feel they have. This can be a new skill or a pursuit of areas of a knowledge expertise or even self-mastery. The evident result is that being misunderstood by those who are still in the first stage. Because they are still stuck in the mediocre boundaries, they resent those who have set themselves free from it. The journey therefore begins alone. It takes immense courage to leave mediocrity to pursue something that is unique. But the path to greatness has only been set off.  


In the third stage, those who have begun their journey alone, are soon resented by those who cannot free themselves. In their pursuit, they start to feel that they are slowly becoming isolated from others. They realize they enjoy quality time doing things that have intrinsic value rather than waste time pretending to mimic mediocrity. Isolation grows severe everyday, and the seeker of great things starts to doubt their journey. Once again, they feel they are missing something.


In the final stage, they realize what they were missing. They were missing themselves. They had been looking for acceptance in others. In that subtle desire, they didn't realize they were denying their own value. The resentment that they escaped haunted them. That is, a part of them still thought and saw themselves as mediocre. But in the final stage, they no longer need self affirmation, or gratification from others. They understand that the path to greatness is better spent on valuing the present, the little gifts and great wisdom in people. Mediocre people now seem like children compared to them. Just as an adult would no longer feel interest to spend excessive time playing with children, the wise and great would find it more rewarding to spend time in solitude and pursue their work.
    
All human beings are born great, but somehow they seem to get stuck in mediocre play. For many, being mediocre is not often a choice. Everyday circumstance forces us to adapt to others, we are, after all, social beings. But the path to greatness is a conscious choice, and a choice always worth making.

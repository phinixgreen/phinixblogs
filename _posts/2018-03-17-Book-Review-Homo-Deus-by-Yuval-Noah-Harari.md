Yuval Noah Harari's Homo Deus follows the line of his genius
macro-historical argument on Human Civilization that he introduced in
the Sapiens.

*Homo Sapiens is us. Humans. Home Deus is the next stage of evolution,
where humans become Gods.*

Harari's sophisticated argument begins with how human struggle had
essentially been about becoming superhuman entities in terms of survival
and wellbeing. So far, this has been a subconscious motivation. But now
this is becoming a conscious movement, he argues. Harari draws our
attention to how humans have grown powerful over nature, through the
taming of many deadly viral diseases and through the domestication of
animals and farming. All of these had been subconscious attempts to
survive in the wild.

Contemporary movements such as transhumanism consciously argue that
humans deserve more longevity if not an eternal life. But as Harari
points out, humans, by evolution, are not capable enough to handle the
everlasting life of pleasure and happiness, and that an eternal life
won't be of much value to us if it does not bring us adequate
satisfaction. And so, overcoming death and becoming capable of enjoying
everlasting happiness and pleasure has emerged at the forefront of the
human quest for transcendence.

### Murky Path to Progress {#9010 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="9010"}

Harari goes on to show that we are already accomplishing amazing feats
using cutting edge technology. Machines do most of our work nowadays.
Yet the path to the present state of human society was made by endless
unrecorded murky deeds. He attacks the established, everyday
anthropocentric values which we barely pause to notice. How does one
justify breeding animals in captivity, or killing thousands of rats in
the name of scientific discoveries? Are we really as superior as we
think we are to all other species in the planet? Harari says that we
justify this denial by telling stories that glorify human existence over
other life-forms.

### Invisible Rulers {#c3e0 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="c3e0"}

Harari also argues that we were free until we started to settle as
agricultural societies. Which I kind of agree. Everything that we do to
make ourselves feel better and survive better, also entraps us into an
invisible system. He calls it the intersubjective reality.

> We are controlled by legal entities that everyone believes in, but
> doesn't even exist.

Google, money, law, none of it exists, but they control our lives. He
calls these fictions. In that sense, religion is also a kind of fiction,
and Harari explains that the emergence of faith was needed to organize
chaotic societies. It's interesting to realize how society sets stories
for each of us, and however oppressive or empowering, we are forced to
follow them. In order to live in the society we need to believe in these
stories or risk being outcasted.

### Uncomfortable Futures {#23b0 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="23b0"}

In fact, we are already very uncomfortable with the destination towards
which our civilization is progressing. Humans are becoming capable of
engineering their own offsprings. Such human augmentation could lead to
unforeseeable changes in the society. On one hand, the sacred image of
individualism is on decline and on the other human collective is on the
rise.

> All the things that made us, humans, feel human are going to change.

Religion protests these social changes accompanied by technological
advancement. Science, on the other hand, does nothing to alleviate this
situation since its task is to deconstructs the stories made by religion
into cold hard facts. Thus, stuck in the loop of story making and
deconstructing, Harari identifies how wars have been waged for centuries
between the followers of scientific method and the religious dogma. Yet,
the author also concludes that for the purpose of progress and unity,
both science and religion needs each other.

### The Fourth Revolution {#a143 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="a143"}

All these elements, he spins them, and weaves them into his main
argument --- in search of divine-like powers, we have ended up creating
Artificial Intelligence, and now we are on the verge of being
substituted by it. With dataism taking over, religion may at some point
become extinct. And if everything can be explained by data, then all the
old theories and ideologies will become redundant.

> Human society kicked off with the cognitive revolution. Then came the
> agricultural revolution. We had lived most of our lives in the
> aftermath of Industrial Revolution. In this three phases, humans have
> been unquestionably dominant. Now that we are entering the era of
> Artificial Intelligence, and with Artificially Intelligent entities
> learning from us and taking over the world silently, how long until we
> are fully replaced by them?

Harari ends by leaving the readers with some profoundly confusing
choices. The one I liked translates- Given the choice between pointless
survival and sentimental extinction, do we choose to merge with
inorganic intelligence or perish as living conscious organisms?

### Endnote {#77e3 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="77e3"}

All in all, the book pretty much sums up all you need to know about the
contemporary state of world and a brief history of the future of
humanity. There's a huge pile of reference at the end of the book, which
I think many will be able to make use of for further studies.

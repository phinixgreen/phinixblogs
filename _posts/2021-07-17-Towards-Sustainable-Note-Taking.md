## What I started with

In 2016, I was a Masters Student at BRAC University, studying full-time, and yet faced a peculiar problem. I kept taking notes whenever I read a text, yet when needed, I had a hard time finding them. My notes were all over the place, and I did not know how to organize my notes, let alone effectively make use of the notes that I have taken so meticulously.

So this forced me to look into a growing movement of note-taking frameworks and tools, to see how I could take notes easily, and yet sustain them as long as I can.

## Tools, Mindsets and Paradigm Shifts

The fundamental shift in my thinking started to begin when I was looking for a sustainable way to note-taking. I used to take notes in virtually all possible apps available to me. Google Keep, Apple Notes, Google Docs, Word, Pages. I realized that my notes were getting scattered due to easy access to quickly take notes. And that was only part of the equation.

Even after 2016 to mid 2017, I continued with this method, and still found that whenever I moved my Google Docs, Pages, or Word files from Google Drive to OneDrive, or Dropbox, files easily got corrupted. Needless to say, it was pretty frustrating. I was looking for a way to keep my notes safe. At the same time, I was looking to create a protocol for keeping these notes organized.

The first revolution in my thinking pattern started with Markdown. In an app called Notion. Even now, I write in markdown when possible. The thing with markdown and plain-text files is that they are virtually the most basic type of file, and do not easily get corrupted. More so, they can be translated into other file formats easily. Docx, EPUB, PDF you name it.

## Values and Challenges

Unfortunately, not many proprietary softwares at the time allowed for plain-text note-taking. Those that did, required dedicated storage purchase. Even now, I am skeptical about keeping my files in Notion. There's a strange phenomenon called the *Shiny Object Syndrome* that leads individuals to using different apps at different times, shifting here and there, which obviously doesn't help if you're trying to build a sustainable knowledge-base.

Now we have Obsidian, Roam Research, as well as OneNote and Evernote in new updates. Still, I have decided to rely on plain-text files.

Plain-text files are easy to store, move, edit. The hard part is embedding files and other formats. You need to learn some syntax for that. The learning curve is a bit steep, but once I got the hang of it, and having been to both sides, I did not want to return to my old methods.

## Where I am now

I currently host my notes on GitHub. Github offers a few perks that are undeniably awesome. One of them is version control, and the others are additional features like integrating into a quick-built website or other services. Importing and exporting is also easier. It is, however, unlike OneDrive or Google Drive though, and the interface is quite a bit different.

Currently, I capture notes in Apple Notes, Physical Notebooks and Sublime Text depending on the situation. I write my reflections on these notes in VS Code, a fine tool for coding, but comes with a lot of perks for note-takers as well. Finally, I organize my notes in GitHub Repositories.

## Outlook

I have shared a tool based approach, but there are other meta-frameworks involved. Zettelkasten by Niklas Luhmann and PARA by Tiago Forte, helped me a lot to organize my notes, and I hope to write about them at a later time.

I am sharing this with my fellow readers and knowledge-workers to inspire them to think about note-security and sustainability. We put a lot of effort, as researchers and free-thinkers, on the thought-works that we conceive. It's a shame when these notes gets corrupted, or are lost due to lack of organization. Having a sustainable note-base can significantly boost your knowledge. Most of our works of knowledge, wisdom and data are scattered throughout social media. So why not own our own words and thoughts and keep them safe, organized and within our reach?

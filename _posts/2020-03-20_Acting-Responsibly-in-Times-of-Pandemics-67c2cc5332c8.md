### **Acting Responsibly in Times of Pandemics** {#ba1e .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--figure .graf--title name="ba1e"}

*A short guide to measures in times of COVID-19*

[U]{.graf-dropCap}nderstanding the source and nature of threat in times
of crisis is important for survival. Amidst misinformation and panic in
social media, researchers and doctors are relentlessly collecting data
to battle COVID-19 / Coronavirus / 2019-nCov. As lay persons, our duty
is to do as advised by the experts. This document outlines some of the
recommendations provided by the health experts working at the front
line. We recommend that you give this a read and do some reading on your
own from [this
source](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor}.

***Brief --- From*** [***Are we ready for the new
coronavirus?***](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1579212920300409?via%253Dihub){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor}

"On 31 December 2019: China (Wuhan) announces 27 cases of pneumonia
related to a seafood and live animal market. On 7 January 2020, a new
coronavirus is identified as the cause: 2019-nCoV, renamed COVID-19 by
the World Health Organization (WHO) and on 11 February 2020 we have
since seen its rapid spread."

***Forecast***

**Risks --- From** [**Pay attention to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in
children**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ped4.12178){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor}

> "Most patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are middle‐aged and elderly
> individuals; the majorities of patients who were critically ill and
> patients who died comprised frail older adults and individuals with
> underlying diseases."

> "Because SARS‐CoV‐2 is an emerging virus, there is no specific
> antiviral treatment for the disease caused by this virus. Currently,
> the therapy of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is symptomatic and supportive."

**What to Expect --- From** [**'No one is allowed to go out': your
stories from the coronavirus
outbreak**](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00478-7){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor}

1.  [There might be death tolls]{#4077}
2.  [Visa process could tighten]{#c307}
3.  [Food and commodite price may spike]{#5b4b}
4.  [Travelling may become difficult]{#5ef2}
5.  [International travelers may face block on going home]{#39c8}
6.  [Prejudice or discrimination on Asian origins]{#cd19}
7.  [Lab supply could be disrupted]{#4115}
8.  [Prices for medical device could rise]{#d04a}
9.  [Deliveries could be delayed]{#6b0e}
10. [Students could get stranded]{#82b7}

***Precaution***

Taking precaution is important. Knowing the mode of transmission helps
in taking precautions.

**Modes of Transmission**

**From** [**Are we ready for the new
coronavirus?**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1579212920300409?via%253Dihub){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor}

Transmission could happen from

1.  [Close Contact]{#df3d}
2.  [Respiratory Droplet]{#1d2d}
3.  [Contaminated hands]{#a124}
4.  [Infected Surfaces such as metal, glass, plastics for more than 9
    days]{#2130}
5.  [Fecal-oral (may be)]{#b25b}
6.  [Asymptomatic carriers]{#0761}

***Prevention***

Once we know the modes of transmission, we can take preventive measures
as well.

**From** [**Are we ready for the new
coronavirus?**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1579212920300409?via%253Dihub){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor}

All persons with symptoms should maintain

-   [Cough Etiquette]{#8135}
-   [Hand Hygiene]{#0d24}

Principle of Preventive Action Should Be Applied

-   [Visual Alert should be posted at strategic locations]{#eeed}
-   [Instructions on cough etiquette and hand hygiene should be
    explained]{#fe18}
-   [Strategic locations include isolation in Private room, restricted
    access]{#9274}
-   [Visitors should take precaution against contact and droplet before
    entering Confirmed or Suspected Infected area]{#59bb}

Preventive measure is required

-   [as soon as case is suspected]{#54b6}
-   [includes hand hygiene within 5 moments of interaction, before and
    after removing facemasks]{#546f}

Consumable Facemask should be

-   [Single Use]{#2471}
-   [If shared between patients, should be cleaned and disinfected
    before reuse]{#8ae4}

Consult this resource for using masks the proper way ([WHO's Advice on
Using
Masks](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/documents/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-2019-ncov.pdf){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor})

Waste Management

-   [Cleaning staff should use protective equipment]{#dae0}
-   [Consumables which are not cleanable or disinfectable are Class III
    Biomedical Waste.]{#9259}

The transmission of this disease can be reduced

-   [by detecting and isolating carriers]{#6376}
-   [developing drugs and vaccines]{#ad93}
-   [educating public on prevention]{#6661}
-   [reducing the number of contacts]{#aeb1}

***Detection***

**Symptoms**

**From** [**Are we ready for the new
coronavirus?**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1579212920300409?via%253Dihub){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor}

1.  ["The disease may have flu-like symptoms (high temperature, myalgia,
    respiratory symptoms, and possible progression to pneumonia),
    although with less abrupt onset, and upper respiratory symptoms
    appear to be insignificant or absent in coronavirus infection. In
    both influenza and coronavirus, most patients do not present severe
    disease, but others may develop pneumonia. In hospitalized patients
    with COVID-19 pneumonia, 26% required intensive care; 61% of these
    developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and 30% shock"]{#7fa9}

***Management***

**From** [**Are we ready for the new
coronavirus?**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1579212920300409?via%253Dihub){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor}

> "Management involves isolation, symptomatic treatment, and support
> measures."

**From** [**Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): The need to maintain regular
physical activity while taking
precautions**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254620300144?via%253Dihub){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor}

"Exercise at home using various safe, simple, and easily implementable
exercises is well suited to avoid the airborne coronavirus and maintain
fitness levels. Such forms of exercise may include, but are not limited
to, strengthening exercises, activities for balance and control,
stretching exercises, or a combination of these. Examples of home
exercises include walking in the house and to the store as necessary,
lifting and carrying groceries, alternating leg lunges, stair climbing,
stand-to-sit and sit-to-stand using a chair and from the floor, chair
squats, and sit-ups and pushups."

***Mitigation***

**Community Mitigation --- From** [**Covid-19 and community mitigation
strategies in a
pandemic**](https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m1066){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor}

> "No specific drugs or vaccines are available, and health systems are
> overburdened everywhere. We have to rely on targeted, non-coercive,
> community interventions with sufficient transparency and public
> engagement and trust, and implement them urgently. Such measures may
> help delay the exponential spread of the outbreak until drugs become
> available. Transparency and trust are critical to preserving a calm
> and compliant response to mitigation advice among the public."

Key community mitigation strategies include-

-   [Cancellation of ad hoc events and suspension of events with
    superspreader potential]{#4dad}
-   [Use of social distancing measures to reduce direct and close
    contact between people in the community]{#67c5}
-   [Travel restrictions, including reduced flights and public transport
    and route restrictions without compromising essential
    services]{#cbed}
-   [Voluntary home quarantine of members of household contacts]{#4bcd}
-   [Changes to funeral services to minimise crowd size and exposure to
    body fluids of the diseased]{#4288}
-   [Clear communication from national and international health
    authorities to ensure verified information and avoid fake news,
    rumours, and panic]{#5e95}

Travel is the single most important contributor to disease transmission.
Absolute travel bans may increase fear and affect the travel of
essential staff and the timely movement of supplies. Home deliveries of
essential commodities may be feasible in some communities. Reduced
frequency of transport (flights, trains) and route restrictions could be
proposed, along with community sensitisation, aiming to reduce the
demand for travel.

The PPE includes

-   [eye protection (goggles),]{#4464}
-   [a filtering facepiece respirator (N95),]{#07bd}
-   [a surgical cap,]{#16de}
-   [gloves,]{#d782}
-   [a fluid-resistant gown,]{#86c9}
-   [and shoe covers]{#9c9f}

"Healthcare professionals should wear a gown (if not waterproof and
splashes are anticipated, add a plastic apron), FFP3 mask --- single use
in accordance with European standard EN149:2001 (American equivalent,
NIOSH N95), with special emphasis on correct use --- gloves and eye
protection."

**For Governments**

Here are some learnings from the Governments across the world fighting
the Pandemics.

**From** [**Communication, collaboration and cooperation can stop the
2019
coronavirus**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0775-x){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor}

> "In the face of global infectious-disease emergencies, countries have
> a responsibility to be transparent in their reporting and actions,
> both to their own populations and to the international community, in
> order to facilitate and accelerate cooperation that will ultimately
> curtail outbreaks and minimize harm."

**From** [**COVID-19 in Singapore --- Current
Experience**](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2761890){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor}

Since its experience with the SARS outbreak in 2003 when 238 people were
infected, Singapore has been systematically strengthening its ability to
manage another emerging infectious disease outbreak. These include-

-   [the construction of National Centre for Infectious Diseases and
    National Public Health Laboratory;]{#913d}
-   [significant expansion in the number of negative-pressure isolation
    beds throughout the public hospital system;]{#aad9}
-   [stockpiling of personal protective equipment (PPE) and
    masks;]{#1cb6}
-   [establishment of formal platforms for multi-Ministry and
    cross-agency coordination;]{#3506}
-   [development of a strong capability to perform contact tracing
    quickly and at scale;]{#02f9}
-   [training of health professionals including in the correct use of
    PPE;]{#be24}
-   [and building more biosafety level 3 laboratories.]{#2401}

In addition, as part of Singapore's major investments in biomedical
science and clinical research and translation capabilities, a
significant focus has been placed on building expertise in infectious
diseases."

**For Celebrity / Popular / Religious Figures --- From** [**Covid-19 and
community mitigation strategies in a
pandemic**](https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m1066){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor}

"Mass gatherings and events such as music festivals, religious
gatherings, cultural celebrations, conferences, and political events
should be restricted. Respiratory infections are most commonly
transmitted at such events. Even when the R0 is low, the crowd density
during mass gatherings predisposes to high rates of transmission. On 27
February 2020 Saudi Arabia suspended the year round Umrah pilgrimage,
and the transmission of covid-19 in the country has been low. This
contrasts with Iran, which did not intervene in the religious pilgrimage
in Qom and has seen large regional outbreaks. Organisers of other mass
gatherings --- including the 2020 Olympic Games, Dubai Expo 2020, and
Hajj pilgrimage --- will need to make decisions about risks and
benefits."

**For Businesses --- From** [**Covid-19 and community mitigation
strategies in a
pandemic**](https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m1066){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor}

"Office space is another enabling environment for respiratory disease
transmission. New shift work and rotation schedules seeking to decrease
social density can minimise disease propagation. Telemedicine, video
conferencing, telecommuting, and expanded leave policies may help staff
adhere to social distancing policies."

### {#2c97 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--figure .graf--title name="2c97"}

I don't like my skin. And even if you peeled the skin off, you wouldn't
like them anyway. So how can I?

How could I ever fly away from myself, without being what is me? I am
now a bag of trash, waiting for my time to be disposed of in due course.
I don't mind being kicked at, I can't laugh out loud even if I was some
maniac. Even if I did, wouldn't you be surprised to see a trash can
laughing in agony? And who would have time to feel at loss, why a trash
can that has no use at all should be laughing anyway? We all laugh
sometimes, even in hardest of our struggles, we force laughter to bring
smiles. But what are smiles if there is nothing inside that dirty pile
of trashes that no one wants?

I don't like my skin. But my skin won't just leave me.

No matter how much I scratch, and itch, and bash and stab it, it just
won't go away from me. I cannot change who I am. And I cannot fly away
from being me.

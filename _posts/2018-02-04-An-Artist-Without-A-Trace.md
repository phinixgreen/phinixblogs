Dear Sherline,

First of all, Happy 17th. Don't be afraid, you know me well. You
consider yourself an introvert with lots of secrets. You want to dye
your hair purple. I think you should and you would on the very day of
your next birthday. And you're going to meet the guy you've been looking
for all your life. Aren't you happy? I think you'd be! Because you need
a guy to lean onto. Don't let him go. But you know, I'm really sorry
because he won't stay with you. Neither the next guy, nor the next. But
four is a lucky number for you, isn't it? You live in the house number
four, and you have four brothers too! I know what you're thinking, but I
can assure you- this is not a prank. If it were I wouldn't warn you to
take a walk on Park Street in the afternoon of 3rd December. But of
course you're already crazy to find out why I said so, and you will.
Anyways, don't let a broken wrist stop your writing. I hope your fourth
lover will understand and I wish the best for you two. And don't blame
if he disagrees with your lifestyle, after all this is nothing but a
figment of your imagination, and even though you will keep trying to
find out, don't blame me for the death of your family, everyone
eventually dies, but accidents are unpredictable. And if you think you
can predict well, well you'll eventually come to believe that too, and I
hope you don't blame the people for thinking you schizophrenic, they
know nothing about you, you and me, well....I am sorry just as you will
be. And don't hesitate to beat up that asshole if he tries to dominate
you, you'll be an independent woman, and people change and so will he,
so on the night of your 4th Anniversary you'll know what to do, you'll
write this letter, and leave without a trace. And I promise, your fans
will miss you. But this will be your greatest masterpiece, ever, as an
artist without a trace.

Love

Sherline

It takes a strong will to give up habits that are harmful. This post is not about which social media you should quit, rather a general guideline to help you be aware of what you have gotten yourself into.</p><h4 name="17a1" id="17a1" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Knowing the Signs of Good Habits and Bad Habits</h4><p name="9734" id="9734" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Deciding what is good and what is bad can be quite hard in contemporary times. For the sake of understanding let us define <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Good Habits</strong> as <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">patterns of behavior that are hard to acquire</em>, which don’t come to us naturally, and takes conscious effort to build yet easy to give up. These habits require our willingness to understand their significance and effect in our lives. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Bad Habits</strong>, on the other hand, are the opposite; we pick up these habits almost unconsciously, and become addicted to them.These are the behaviors that are very hard to give up. The only thing common between bad habits and good habits is that they both have long-term consequences in our lives and those around us.</p><p name="d3f2" id="d3f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The good news is that, if you are willing to take measures to reduce your screen-time and improve the quality of your inner life, help is here.</p><h4 name="fb76" id="fb76" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Some Helpful Techniques to Overcome Social Media Addiction</h4><p name="124c" id="124c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">There is a concept out there that our habits are activated by the way we interact with our environment. A person who eats a lot, usually has foods around them that are easily reachable. In our case, we are activated by the very device that we use ubiquitously. For most of us who frequently check in to social media sites, Social Media habits are usually the same .</p><blockquote name="d408" id="d408" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">We keep our social media apps installed. The notifications are always on for messaging services. We often visit social media sites, hoping to find something that we cannot describe to ourselves. We pick up our phone when we are bored, or don’t want to be where we are. If you do it too, then you, my friend, should do something about it as soon as possible.</blockquote><p name="6b78" id="6b78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why?</strong> Let’s consider the opportunity cost of these habits. You let yourself get distracted when notifications hit the bell. You feel interested to see what’s the fuss about. You feel compelled, almost automatically, to tap your way into the social media site. Once you get there, you realize that you can’t help scrolling a bit, and then a bit more, and on and on it goes on. The people in your life, wait for you to respond, your children look at you, but you’re absorbed in the device in your palm, and the people who invited you to talk waits for you to respond, and ends up behaving the same as you do. In parties, social gatherings, we don’t socialize anymore, we all go sit together and scroll on and on.</p><p name="39b1" id="39b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hopefully, with a little awareness, you can change your habits slightly to battle this addiction. Here’s what I did, and how it has helped me.</p><h4 name="ab79" id="ab79" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Deleting Social Media Apps from Cell-Phone</h4><p name="b6f4" id="b6f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I think it is safe to announce that I don’t have social media apps installed in my phone. By deleting these apps from my phone, I am making it harder for myself to tap and jump into the social media . That is, I have intentionally made the activation potentials lesser than before, and this successfully alters my behavior of accessing social media. I do end up re-installing the apps sometimes. But each time I delete those apps, I am also forcing myself to refrain from reinstalling the apps in my phone.</p><h4 name="d002" id="d002" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Turn Off Notifications for the Messaging Apps</h4><p name="8f0c" id="8f0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This is a game-changer. I still have some essential messaging apps installed. The reason for this is mostly because work and networking culture is gaining momentum in my circles. However, I think most of us has had these experiences of notifications popping in the middle of something and effectively interrupting our attention.</p><p name="5432" id="5432" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have all my notifications turned off. By doing this, I still get to see my messages when I am free, but I have more control over my own time by reducing the possibility to be disturbed by frequent untimely notifications. Having notifications turned off pays off very well when I go to sleep, or when I am with my family.</p><h4 name="b528" id="b528" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Recognize that Social Media (and Your Device) is Basically a Marketing Technique</h4><p name="de2d" id="de2d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Social Media sites are designed in such a way, that they can make you behave in a predefined scenario (exactly the way designers would want you to behave). Most users who are frequently available on social media follow a common user experience flow that invites them to share information about themselves, even when it’s not necessary. A notification, or a shining app-icon that stands out, or even you, unconsciously reaching out to the keyboard, is the kind of behavior that the social media engineers would want you to do. Once you respond to these leads, you are invited to scroll, until you are compelled to pick up a call to action: a comment, a share, a like, a decision to subscribe. These sites even give you subtle incentives when you interact with them. What all these mean is that the design is effective when you engage with it constantly. By performing the call to action, you essentially let yourself fall into the trap of lead generation.</p><h4 name="7eaf" id="7eaf" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Make Use of the Screen Time Monitoring</h4><p name="dca7" id="dca7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I learned this from my partner, who regularly monitors her screen time. If your device has a screen time monitoring feature, do make use of it. Seeing how much we waste time and effort on irrelevant pursuits, can motivate us to change our habits. With some devices, you can limit the amount of time you spend on social media. Features like these remind you when you spend too much time in the wonderland, and effectively interrupting the continuous flow of doom scrolling.</p><h4 name="77ee" id="77ee" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Keep the Phone Away</h4><p name="24fb" id="24fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">If you can, put your cell phone away when you don’t really need it. If you keep a fidget spinner in your hand, you will surely be tempted to play with it. Similarly, having a device that allows for swiping or tapping, invites you to engage with the lead generating traps. By putting your phone away, you let the process of accessing social media be a bit less easy for yourself.</p><h4 name="1031" id="1031" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Last but not the Least: Smile and Focus on What Needs to be Done</h4><p name="d6ba" id="d6ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Social media hardly gives you information that you need. Sometimes it does let you see what you want, but it is only a sign that the social media knows too much about you, that such insights are being sold to countless vendors who hacks your mind and convinces you to buy their products.</p><p name="abb8" id="abb8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By default we all know that family matters more than social media, friends matter more than random strangers, and meaningful socialization matters more than pointless pursuit of interactions. Wisdom has it that the past cannot be changed, the future cannot always be predicted, but the present is where we can put effort to change things that matter.</p><blockquote name="e129" id="e129" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p graf--trailing">So don’t let irrelevant information distract your purpose, your time with family and yourself. Value the people who are there with you, in your life. Time is precious, and so is your attention. Share it with those who matter, not to things that do not give you anything more than perpetual anxiety.</blockquote></div></div></section>

### Using Version Control, Markdown and LaTeX for Academic Writing {#ca53 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--figure .graf--title name="ca53"}

#### Introduction {#57a1 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--h3 .graf--subtitle name="57a1"}

Academic writing workflow is a very essential part of academic research.
Having a feasible and sustainable writing system is a growing concern
for many academics. This post will describe a writing method that was
tested for writing a paper.

The goal is to have a system that is feasible, sustainable over time and
accessible from anywhere. Central to this mechanism is the philosophy of
**Version Control**. According to
[Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor} -

> "Version control systems are a category of software tools that help a
> software team manage changes to source code over time. Version control
> software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special
> kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the
> clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake
> while minimizing disruption to all team members."

There are many tools which can be used for **Version Control**. GitHub
is one prominent tool. According to
[Kinsta](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-github/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor} -

> "GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps \[...\] store
> and manage \[...\] as well as track and control changes to code."

Although primarily used for software testing, academics can make use of
this service for academic writings.

The other tools needed for this method are **Markdown** and **LaTeX**
editors. According to
[Ultraedit](https://www.ultraedit.com/company/blog/community/what-is-markdown-why-use-it.html){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor}, **Markdown** is -

> "a plain text formatting syntax aimed at making writing for the
> internet easier."

It is a good tool for drafting papers.

**LaTeX** is document preparation system which can be used for preparing
final product of the draft for presentation and submission.

**Atom** and **Overleaf** are two services that were used for this
method.

#### Methodology {#5cd6 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="5cd6"}

The following methods were followed for setting up the system. First, a
[GitHub](https://github.com/){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor}
repository was opened. Second, [GitHub
Desktop](https://desktop.github.com){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor}
was downloaded and installed. The software can be logged in to using
respective GitHub Account. Third,
[Atom](https://atom.io){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor} was
downloaded and installed. Atom can be integrated with GitHub.

The annotations for sample papers were pre-collected. Each section of
the paper were divided into single .md file. These files were edited in
Atom. Each .md file had multiple quotes, references and questions. The
quotes were used and elaborated to answer the questions as well as
evaluated when necessary. The references were collected in a
separated .md file called "References" and the BibTeX format was pasted
in the References section.

Finally, when the drafting was done, all the references were pasted
in .bib file of [Overleaf](http://overleaf.com/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor} project. The sections were copied and pasted in the
corresponding parts of the Overleaf project. The Overleaf back end was
scanned for citation linking and errors. Afterwards, the project was
ready for compilation.

#### Evaluation {#a83a .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="a83a"}

The method has several benefits. Markdown software are easy to set up
and the protocol for markdown is same regardless of software. Version
control enables tracking the changes in markdown file which is good for
reviewing. GitHub provides cloud service, meaning it can be accessed and
edited from most compatible devices. Furthermore, Atom can be customized
and adapted to suit the visual and technical needs of the writer. GitHub
also allows for project management and collaboration. The method
described is manual, and might take a lot of effort to learn and deploy.
It is therefore recommended to test several times before actually using
for a project.

#### Final thoughts {#a2df .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="a2df"}

A good drafting strategy can take away the burden of organizing new
systems over and over again. The described system have been proven to be
feasible and sustainable to the author. GitHub, Markdown and LaTeX are
often closely compatible. It may also be possible to automate this
method further.
